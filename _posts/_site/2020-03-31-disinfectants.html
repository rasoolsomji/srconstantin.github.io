<p>A little good news on the COVID-19 front: yes, you can kill the virus on surfaces, with easily available disinfectants.</p>

<p>Copper surfaces, silver particles, alcohol-based disinfectants, and UV light will kill the virus.  Frequently touched items, especially in public places, should probably just be irradiated with UVC light and/or coated with copper as a routine prevention measure.</p>

<p>(Regular UV light is an effective disinfectant but can also blind people and burn skin; UVC is a shorter wavelength, equally effective against microbes but not harmful to eyes or skin.)</p>

<p><strong>Do Copper Surfaces Kill/Inactivate Coronaviruses?</strong></p>

<p>In an experiment with aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, at 21-23 degrees C and 40% humidity, both reached undetectable levels within 8 hours exposure to copper; by contrast, they lasted 72 hours on stainless steel and plastic.[1]</p>

<p>H1N1 influenza, which was another pandemic virus, though not a coronavirus, lasted significantly less time on copper than stainless steel; 10^5 viable viruses after 24 hours on stainless steel vs. 10^2 viable viruses after 2 hours on copper.[2]</p>

<p>Human coronavirus 229E remains infectious on plastic, ceramic, glass, and stainless steel for at least 5 days, was inactivated in less than 5 minutes on copper and brass when applied dry, and inactivated in less than an hour when applied in solution to metal alloys containing &gt;75% copper.[4]</p>

<p>Using copper-coated surfaces in real-world environments reduces microbial contamination. In 5 residential healthcare facilities, where half of the doorknobs and handrails were coated with copper alloys while half were not, the bacterial concentration was significantly (p &lt; 0.0001) lower on the copper-coated doorknobs and handrails.[5]  Similarly, when weights and grips in a gym were coated with copper alloy or left as rubber or stainless steel, the bacterial concentrations on the copper-coated surfaces were 94% lower than the controls.[6]</p>

<p><strong>Silver Ion Zeolites as Anti-Microbial Surfaces</strong></p>

<p>Commercially available silver zeolite powder (AgION powder, manufactured by Sinanen Co.) completely inactivated SARS-CoV at concentrations above 375 mg/L.  </p>

<p>Zeolites are fine, talc-like powders that can be incorporated into coatings to produce antimicrobial surfaces; the FDA has approved zeolites for use in food packaging.[3]</p>

<p><strong>Disinfectants</strong></p>

<p>In a study of 7 disinfectant liquids on the SARS coronavirus, including several with &gt;80% ethanol as active ingredient, all of them significantly reduced SARS concentrations, by a factor of at least 1000.[7]</p>

<p>70%+ ethanol was effective at reducing (by a factor of &gt;1000) the infectivity of both SARS and MERS coronaviruses; so was 50%+ 2-propanol, hydrogen peroxide, glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, and povidone iodine. Chlorhexidine was not effective.[9]</p>

<p>In a study of human coronaviruses 229E and OC43, soap, bleach, and Proviodine (the active ingredient was iodine) all completely inactivated the viruses.[8]</p>

<p>Axe dishwashing detergent, sodium hypochlorite solution, and the disinfectant Virkon S, all killed SARS-CoV virus by a factor of at least 1000.[10]</p>

<p>Against two coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus, a solution of 70% ethanol reduced viral infectivity by a factor of &gt;1000; phenolic, sodium hypochlorite, and orthopthalaldehyde did not.[11]</p>

<p><strong>UVC Radiation</strong></p>

<p>Exposure of SARS virus to UVC radiation for six minutes results in a 400-fold reduction in infectivity.  UVA and gamma radiation did not affect infectivity.[12]  Another study of SARS found 1000-fold inactivation from 15 minutes of exposure to UVC.[13]</p>

<p>A study of Ebola virus and MERS virus found that UVC light at &gt;0.1 J/cm^2 reduced infectivity more than 5000-fold in both.  Methylene blue plus light at &gt;30 J/cm^2 also reduced infectivity 2000-fold in both.[14]</p>

<p>Far-UVC light (207-222 nm) inactivates bacteria without harm to human skin.  It also reduces H1N1 infectivity by 100-fold at low doses: 2 mJ/cm^2.[15]</p>

<p>222-nm far-UVC light applied to a mouse wound where MRSA bacteria had been spread reduced skin bacteria concentrations by &gt;1000-fold, just like 254-nm conventional antimicrobial UV irradiation, but only the 254-nm light increased skin thickness significantly ( a measure of skin damage.)[16]</p>
