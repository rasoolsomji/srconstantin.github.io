<p>So, I have again <strong>changed jobs</strong> — I am now working at <a href="http://starskyrobotics.com/">Starsky Robotics</a> helping build self-driving trucks!</p>

<p>I’m still interested in biotech, but there are a lot of interesting problems in autonomous vehicles that I’m excited to work on. Also, this job is in San Francisco, unlike my last job, and since I am <strong>pregnant</strong>, I’d like to work in the same state as my future kid.</p>

<p>The great thing about California is that local laws allow freelancing, so I am once again <strong>open for business</strong>, to the extent that I have time.  If you have a question that could benefit from a personalized literature review, particularly in the biomedical sciences, I can do that, and you can contact me at <strong>srconstantin@gmail.com.</strong></p>

<p>Currently my main freelance research project is surveying current experimental avenues for life extension, in cooperation with an investor who’s interested in funding longevity research. I <em>love</em> working on stuff like this, and will be updating this blog with progress.</p>

<p>I’m also going to start seriously preparing to <strong>get my cancer research book published</strong>, which, I’m told, involves doing your own marketing. I’m going to be looking for opportunities to write shorter articles for magazines/blogs and otherwise get publicity, so if you know of any good venues, please let me know.</p>
