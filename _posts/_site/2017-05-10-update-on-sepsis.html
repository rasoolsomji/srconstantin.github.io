<p>Dr. Marik’s home university, EVMS, is currently raising money for an RCT of his <a href="https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/04/09/sepsis-cure-needs-an-rct/">sepsis treatment</a>.</p>

<p>You can donate as a private individual <a href="https://giving.evms.edu/give_now_sepsis/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Remember, the whole thing only costs $250,000 — a few people can make a significant dent in that.  The response from my preliminary survey was <em>great</em>, and we clearly have a lot of generous people interested in the sepsis issue.</p>

<p>For my own record-keeping, I’d appreciate it if people who saw this blog post and donated would fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_fqU7BoBHIYnW2_CKelHkcqzcAKmJwNSRUFqg-e5zjnX98w/viewform?usp=sf_link">this form</a>; I’d like to be able to congratulate my blog readers on our total amount raised.</p>
