<p>So, remember how I was urging people to donate for a randomized controlled trial of a <a href="https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/04/09/sepsis-cure-needs-an-rct/">new treatment for sepsis?</a></p>

<p>I’ve been informed by some people who work with the <a href="http://www.openphilanthropy.org/">Open Philanthropy Project</a>, which does research into giving opportunities that I really respect, that there are already foundations which are likely to fund an RCT for the treatment.  This means that donations from private individuals are no longer necessary.</p>

<p>(A quick rundown of the logic behind this: if you’re trying to give “optimally”, you want to pay attention to the marginal returns of your dollars.  If you give the <em>first _dollar to a great opportunity that nobody else will fund, your marginal impact is huge. If you give a dollar to the same great opportunity, but somebody else has already pledged $10M, then your dollar has become a lot less useful, because pretty much any goal has diminishing marginal returns on investment.  If your motivation for giving to charity is _achieving a goal as cheaply as possible</em>, you should move away from charities that are already adequately funded, and towards opportunities that are underfunded. This is a simple idea but it took me a surprisingly long time to understand!)</p>

<p>If you already gave to <a href="https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/05/10/update-on-sepsis/">Eastern Virginia Medical School</a> for the sepsis trial, your money’s not refundable, but it’s still being dedicated to sepsis research.</p>

<p>General implications I’d draw from this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This is another example, as GiveWell and OpenPhil have found many times, of the principle that <em>finding good giving opportunities is hard</em>. It’s hard for the same reason finding good investment opportunities is hard. If something is obviously great, there’s a good chance that professionals have already invested in it. If something is undervalued, it’s probably not _obviously _ great (it’s at least likely to be controversial.)</li>
  <li>This is a positive update on the success of the philanthropic community, esp. in medicine.  Drug companies may not have an incentive to fund trials of cheap, unpatentable treatments, but perhaps foundations do.</li>
  <li>Unfortunately for those of us on the awkward and scruffy side, this suggests that talking to rich people is a useful skill in finding out what’s actually going on in the world.</li>
</ul>
