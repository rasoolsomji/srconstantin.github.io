<p>I’ve been blogging in various places for nearly a decade, but I’ve never actually hosted my own site, or consolidated all my writing in one place.</p>

<p>But now it’s past time for me to start taking my writing/blogging more seriously.<br />
I want it to be searchable and all in one place, and I want to own my own data.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Github now makes hosting easy, and supports the blogging framework Jekyll.</p>

<p>I always find it nice when people are transparent about their process, so I’ll share  mine: it’s taken me about 3-4 days to get Jekyll working and my posts migrated from all my old blogs.</p>

<p>On this site I’ll be aggregating my old posts from <a href="https://srconstantin.wordpress.com">Otium</a>, my <a href="https://srconstantin.posthaven.com">Posthaven site</a>, <a href="https://parentingwithevidence.wordpress.com">Parenting with Evidence</a>, and the now defunct Hourglass Bio.</p>

<p>I’ll cross-promote posts on <a href="//https://twitter.com/s_r_constantin">Twitter</a> (where my handle is @s_r_constantin) and, of course, you can subscribe using RSS.</p>
