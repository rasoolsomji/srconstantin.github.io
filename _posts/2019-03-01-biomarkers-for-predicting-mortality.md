This is an overview and rough effect-size scoring of biomarkers associated with all-cause mortality in observational studies drawn from general populations (i.e. _not _in patients diagnosed with a disease.)

The hazard ratio numbers in the chart are calculated by averaging the hazard ratios in the studies cited below, weighted by study size. Hazard ratios measure the relative risk of all-cause mortality in the “top” vs. “bottom” bin (tertiles, quartiles, etc) of the biomarker.  These averaged numbers should be taken with a grain of salt, because they’re aggregating the results of studies that aren’t strictly comparable; I’ve freely averaged hazard ratios between studies that used different binning formats, or different study populations (differing by country, age, gender, etc) or different follow-up period lengths, or different adjustment procedures (all hazard ratios are adjusted for age and sex, but many are additionally adjusted for other risk factors, like BMI or cholesterol.)  This isn’t intended to be a true meta-analysis, and the rank-ordering of the biomarkers by effect size may not be exact.

The purpose here is to illustrate and summarize what sorts of biomarkers that predict mortality have been observed so far, and to notice some patterns.

First of all, “clinical” rather than biochemical predictors do quite well.

People’s self-assessments of their own health are highly predictive of their mortality risk.  A single measurement of grip strength isn’t far behind. A simple frailty index consisting of 3 criteria (recent weight loss, difficulty standing, self-reported energy levels) does even better.  This is roughly what I’d have predicted; with few exceptions, the best “biomarker of aging” we have is direct observation of the subject’s state of overall health.

The Horvath and Hannum methylation “clocks” (patterns of methylation abnormalities associated with chronological age) don’t have particularly big impacts on mortality risk compared to frailty and self-reported health. The Zhang clock, which came out in 2017, looks quite a bit [better](https://joshmitteldorf.scienceblog.com/2019/02/25/progress-in-methylation-based-aging-clocks/) at predicting mortality. That’s to be expected, since it’s a model trained on mortality rates, not ages.  (In my table I ignored the paper where the Zhang clock is tested on the dataset used to train it, which had an even larger hazard ratio but seemed like an overfitting risk.)  It remains to be seen if other researchers will replicate the Zhang clock.

There are some individual biomarkers that also seem to actually have comparable or larger effects on mortality risk than self-reported health or frailty.

Several are cardiac stress markers.  Troponin T is a protein involved in muscle contractions and elevated during heart attacks.  ST2, the receptor for the cardioprotective cytokine IL-33, is a cardiac biomarker that signals fibrosis from heart failure. (High levels of circulating ST2 in the blood bind to IL-33 and prevent it from doing its job in the heart.)  NT-proBNP is a prohormone secreted by the heart muscle to reduce blood pressure and cardiac output; it is elevated in heart failure.

Others seem to be generalized stress responses.  GDF15 is an inflammatory cytokine which is upregulated during injury to organs and increases with age.  YKL-40 is a glycoprotein which is secreted in response to inflammation, fibrosis, and cancer.  IL-6 is an inflammatory cytokine, nicknamed the “gerontologist’s cytokine”, which is involved in inflammatory and stress responses and is associated with many age-related diseases.

Still others are involved in nutrient sensing.  IGFBP1 is the binding protein for IGF-1, a key protein in the insulin-signaling/nutrient-sensing pathway.  It prevents IGF-1 from taking glucose out of the bloodstream and into tissues to be used for growth; that is, IGFBP1 is anti-proliferative.  It increases with age, and high levels are associated with mortality.  Klotho, on the other hand, is an inhibitor of the insulin-signaling pathway that _decreases _with age, and _low _levels are associated with age-related diseases and mortality.

Homocysteine is an amino acid variant; in high concentrations, it damages cells, leading to blood clots, atherosclerosis, and dementia. Homocysteine levels increase with age and can be elevated by B vitamin deficiencies.

Vitamin D production declines with age as a result of impaired renal function; low vitamin D increases the risk of fractures and falls.

 

Albumin is a protein that regulates blood volume; serum albumin declines with age as a result of impaired liver function and reduced protein intake.

Most of these markers seem more likely to be warning signs of aging processes than viable targets for anti-aging drugs, but they could be useful for more quickly predicting whether interventions are having anti-aging effects on an organism.  Though, as always, when you use a proxy metric without knowing the mechanism, you can’t be sure that the causality goes the right way; for all you know, the intervention is just directly altering the biomarker but not touching the progression of age-related disease.  This is why it’s good to observe that measures of frailty and physical performance are some of the best predictors of mortality; even if we don’t have the time for a long-term study on mortality, an intervention that’s shown to improve frailty is _definitely _valuable for the quality of life of the elderly, while we can’t have that same certainty about an intervention that only affects the concentration of some molecule in the blood.

Additionally, some biomarkers for mortality, like Klotho, _do_ seem to have direct effects on aging and lifespan -- mice that overexpress _Klotho _live longer, and a recently founded [startup](https://www.klotho.com/) is trying to develop a version of the protein as a treatment for chronic kidney disease.

In 2312 participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study, parathyroid hormone was not associated with elevated all-cause mortality.[86]

In 1433 older men, top-quartile PTH levels were associated with a 1.32x risk of all-cause mortality.[87]

In a meta-analysis of 31,616 subjects, elevated PTH increased the risk of all-cause mortality with HR 1.19.[88]

_Resistin_

In a metastudy of 4016 subjects, the adjusted RR for each standard deviation of resistin levels for all-cause mortality is 1.24.[89]

_Selenium_

In 13,887 participants in the NHANES survey, the adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality between the top and bottom tertile of selenium was 0.83.[90]

In 1042 men and women over 64 from the InCHIANTI study, adults in the lowest vs. highest quartile had a hazard ratio for adjusted mortality of 1.6.[91]

_Self-reported health _

Adjusted HR for all-cause mortality between top quintile & bottom quintile of self-reported health was 2.0, in the SHIP study of 4308 subjects.

_sFas_

In 238 nonagenarians, sFas was not independently associated with all-cause mortality.[92]

_ST2_

ST2, part of the IL-1 receptor family, in the top quartile is associated with adjusted all-cause mortality ratio of 2.1 (p &lt; 0.0001), in the Dallas Heart Study of 3294 subjects.[93]

_Uric Acid_

Hazard ratios for hyperuricemia are associated with all-cause mortality in a cohort of 90,393 Chinese adults: hazard ratio 1.16 (p&lt;0.001)[94]

Elevated serum uric acid increased the risk of all-cause mortality in a meta-analysis comprising 172,123 individuals; RR = 1.23[95]

_Testosterone_

In a study of 790 men aged 50-91, men in the bottom quartile of testosterone levels had a relative risk of all-cause mortality of 1.4, adjusted for age, adiposity, and lifestyle.  Adjusting for other risk factors had minimal effect on the relative risk.[96]

_Troponin T_

In 3456 individuals aged 30-65 in the Dallas Heart Study, cardiac troponin T in the top vs. bottom quartile was associated with a 2.8 adjusted RR for all-cause mortality.[97]

In 11,193 participants over age 54, hazard ratios for troponin T in the top fifth vs bottom fifth was associated with a 3.42 adjusted RR for all-cause mortality. [98]

In the ARIC study of 9698 participants over 50, elevated troponin T levels were associated with a hazard ratio of total mortality of 3.96.[99]

In 804 men and 618 women from the ActiFE study in Ulm, elevated troponin T was associated with a hazard ratio of all-cause mortality of 2.97 in women and 1.73 in men.[100]

_Vitamin C_

In 8453 Americans over 30 from the NHANES study, bottom-tertile vitamin C levels were associated with a 1.33x RR of all-cause mortality.[101]

_Vitamin D_

In a meta-study of 32 studies of the association of serum vitamin D levels with all-cause mortality, the hazard ratio was 1.9 (p&lt;0.001). The studies adjusted for age and other variables.[102]

3258 middle-aged male and female subjects had a 2.04x hazard ratio in all-cause mortality between the bottom two quartiles and top two quartiles in vitamin D levels.[103]

In 7161 subjects in the Tromso study, among non-smokers, there was a significant 1.32 relative risk of all-cause mortality in the bottom quartile of vitamin D levels compared to the top quartile. The effect was not significant for smokers.[104]

_YKL-40_

In 115 octogenerians, high YKL-40 levels (top third vs. bottom third) were associated with an adjusted relative risk of 2.20 of all-cause mortality.[105]

In the Copenhagen City Heart Study of 8899 study participants, aged 20-95, hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.9 for individuals in the top 5% of YKL-40 vs. the bottom 33%. Trend, p&lt;0.0001.[106]

In 1407 patients >40 admitted to the Copenhagen hospital and healthy subjects from the Danish Heart Study, top-quartile levels of YKL-40 were associated with a 1.5x adjusted risk of all-cause mortality.[107]

_Zinc_

Zinc is not associated independently with all-cause mortality.[108]
