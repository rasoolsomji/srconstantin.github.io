title: Comprehensive PPE Project List

![shield]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/face_shield.jpg)

The COVID19 crisis has caused a severe shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers. Masks, face shields, respirators, and other supplies help keep the people who care for COVID19 patients from getting sick themselves.  

There’s been a huge outpouring of effort to fix this shortage, by manufacturers, makers, donors, and volunteers. But as of yet, I haven’t seen anything approaching a comprehensive list of who is active in this space.

This is my best attempt at aggregating all the open-source designs for personal protective equipment (PPE), manufacturers and DIY maker groups currently scaling up their production of PPE, and coordination/distribution efforts to get PPE to the health care workers who need it.

I am not a hardware engineer or experienced maker, so I have made no attempt to evaluate these designs myself. I do NOT vouch for the quality of any of these designs. I do mention when a design has already been in use in hospitals, been tested by medical professionals, been certified by a governing body, etc. The only designs I’m putting in the “Bad Ideas” section are those that I’ve seen specific criticism of (e.g. from the [Helpful Engineering ](https://www.helpfulengineering.org/)team.)  

Just because I have not listed a design under “Bad Ideas” does not mean it is a good idea!  If you are considering manufacturing PPE, use your own critical judgment to choose a design!

Likewise, I have not vetted the charities on this list. I make no claims about their competence or integrity.
