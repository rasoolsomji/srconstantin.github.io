title: Tangled Thinking 4 -- Why Do We Self-Deceive?

From an evolutionary perspective, when an organism engages in a behavior that seems to harm itself (that is, reduce its expected number of descendants, either by dying young, having fewer children, or having children that do not survive to maturity), this deserves an explanation. There should be evolutionary pressure against this kind of "self-harm".

There are really only a few possible explanations for a case of apparent "self-harm."

First, the "self-harm" could only be apparent; the behavior could have a non-obvious benefit to the individual's fitness.

For example, consider a peacock's tail. At first glance it is a disadvantage to a peacock to have a huge, unwieldy tail; but sexual selection provides a countervailing advantage. Peacocks with big gaudy tails get to reproduce more often and with higher-fitness mates.

Another example of "self-harm" that is only apparent is what's known as "reciprocal altruism", AKA cooperation or exchange. Animals and humans sometimes give up something of value to help another, which would seem to be an act of self-harm; but usually this is actually an exchange, either formal (as in trade) or implicit (as in owing each other favors). Mutual exchange of help can be more advantageous than isolation.

Thus, neither a peacock's tail nor a human's generous impulses are mysteries from an evolutionary perspective; they are perfectly explainable by evolutionary self-interest.

A second explanation of an apparently "self-harming" trait is that it is indeed harmful to the organism's fitness, but is an unavoidable side effect of something beneficial.  This is called "antagonistic pleiotropy."

For instance, there are many traits that are controlled by more than one gene, or sometimes more than one allele of the same gene, but are only beneficial in moderation. One copy of the gene for sickle-cell disease provides resistance to malaria; two copies causes a debilitating blood disorder. For another example, there are a number of genetic neurological disorders which cause severe disability, but are also correlated with higher-than-average intelligence in the *relatives* of the affected children.  There is, perhaps, a cluster of genes such that having *all* of them is very bad for you, but having a few might be advantageous.
