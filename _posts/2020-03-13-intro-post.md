I've been blogging in various places for nearly a decade, but I've never actually hosted my own site, or consolidated all my writing in one place.

But now it's past time for me to start taking my writing/blogging more seriously.  
I want it to be searchable and all in one place, and I want to own my own data.

Thankfully, Github now makes hosting easy, and supports the blogging framework Jekyll.

I always find it nice when people are transparent about their process, so I'll share  mine: it's taken me about 3-4 days to get Jekyll working and my posts migrated from all my old blogs.


On this site I'll be aggregating my old posts from [Otium][otium], my [Posthaven site][posthaven], [Parenting with Evidence][parenting], and the now defunct Hourglass Bio.

I'll cross-promote posts on [Twitter][twitter] (where my handle is @s_r_constantin) and, of course, you can subscribe using RSS.
