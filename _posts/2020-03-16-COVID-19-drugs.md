**Remdesivir**

An in-silico study of HIV drugs for their docking affinity to a key enzymes in the COVID-19 virus -- RdRp, the main protein for RNA replication -- found an almost perfect match in the antiviral drug remdesivir, suggesting it might be a good candidate drug for treating COVID-19.[3]

Remdesivir also inhibits the COVID-19 virus in vitro.[7]

Remdesivir is effective at reducing the clinical signs of infection and viral load from MERS coronavirus in rhesus macaque monkeys; if given prophylactically, it prevents the monkeys from getting any disease symptoms at all and keeps their viral loads negligible.[10]  In mice, remdesivir is more effective than lopinavir/ritonavir in improving pulmonary function and reducing viral load from MERS infection.[11]

In 3 US patients treated with remdesivir, 2 patients saw fever drop immediately upon receiving the drug (the third didn’t have a fever); one was able to go off supplemental oxygen; all recovered.

Remdesivir is currently in trials in China and the US for COVID-19.

**Chloroquine**

A brief summary document [1] claims that clinical trials in China including over 100 patients have found the antimalarial drug chloroquine phosphate “superior to control treatment” in treating COVID-19 pneumonia and shortening disease course. The paper provided no documentation about experimental methods.

Chloroquine also inhibits the replication of the COVID-19 virus in vitro,[7] as well as the SARS coronavirus in vitro.[9]  It does not inhibit the MERS coronavirus in vitro in a culture of monocyte-derived cells.[13]

Chloroquine frequently causes gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhea, nausea), problems with visual acuity, insomnia, and paresthesias (prickling skin sensations.)[15]  More rarely, chloroquine can cause psychiatric symptoms like depression.


**Cinanserin**

Cinanserin is a serotonin receptor antagonist which was also found to inhibit the replication of the SARS virus in vitro. Cinanserin inhibits the activity of COVID-19’s main protease in vitro, and inhibits the virus’s replication in vitro.[5]

Cinanserin also inhibits the replication of the SARS coronavirus in vitro.[14]

**Lopinavir/Ritonavir**

Lopinavir/Ritonavir is a combination of two antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of HIV.

In one Korean patient, aged 54, with mild pneumonia and a diagnosis of COVID-19, treatment with the antiviral drug combination of lopinavir and ritonavir diminished coronavirus load to undetectable levels.[2]

Lopinavir/Ritonavir was also used by the Thai infectious disease team to successfully treat patients with severe COVID-19.[3]

Lopinavir also had a high binding affinity to the COVID-19 protein 3CL-PRO in an in-silico screen of 3118 FDA-approved drugs.[4]

Lopinavir is a protease inhibitor, effective in vitro against the main protease of the SARS coronavirus; it also has in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV. Lopinavir reduced viral load and clinical symptoms of the MERS coronavirus in mice and marmoset monkeys.[6]  

In human SARS cases, treatment with lopinavir was associated with lower death rate (2.3%) and intubation rate (0%) compared with standard treatment (11% and 15.6% respectively.). Another case-control study of SARS found a lower rate of ARDS in patients treated with lopinavir (2.4% vs 28.8%).  [6]

A retrospective study of 40 patients found that post-exposure prophylaxis including lopinavir/ritonavir reduced the spread of MERS-CoV by 40% in healthcare workers.  However, a retrospective study of 134 COVID-19 patients found no significant difference between lopinavir/ritonavir treatment, Abidol treatment, and control treatment.[6]


**Indinavir**

Indinavir is an antiviral drug used to treat HIV.

In an in-silico screen of the binding affinity of 3118 FDA-approved drugs to several key enzymes of the COVID-19 virus, the highest-affinity drug for the protease PDB-6LU7 was indinavir, an antiviral drug approved for use against HIV.  (Even higher affinity were human proteins that closely resemble the enzyme’s ligand -- ACE2 and GHRP-2.)  Indinavir also had a high binding affinity to another COVID-19 protein, 3CL-PRO.[4]

However, in an in-vitro test against the SARS coronavirus, indinavir did not block replication.[12]


**Thalidomide**

Thalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug used to treat cancers.

A 45-year-old woman with a severe case COVID-19, with fever, pneumonia, dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting, improved and went into remission after being treated with thalidomide, which has anti-inflammatory effects, reducing the “cytokine storm” responsible for the severe symptoms of COVID-19.[7]
