title: Interesting rTMS Results in Healthy People
tags: [lit-review]
---

**Introduction**

This is an overview of selected research on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, or rTMS, which involves applying a coil that produces a rapidly fluctuating magnetic field to the outside of the head, thereby stimulating the surface of the brain beneath the coil.

RTMS is an approved treatment for depression and has been investigated for various other psychiatric disorders, but it’s particularly intriguing that it also seems to have effects on healthy people that include cognitive improvements above the “normal” baseline.

**Summary, by Type of Intervention**

Note: stimulation of &lt;1 Hz is generally thought to have an inhibitory effect on a brain region, while stimulation of >5 Hz is thought to have an excitatory effect.

I only include results that have been observed in at least two studies and not been disconfirmed.

I focus on studies in healthy subjects, and on improvements rather than impairments.

**Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, Inhibitory**



* Increased accuracy on working memory tasks (2)

**Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, Excitatory**



* Reduced addiction symptoms (2)
* Reduced stress response to criticism (3)
* Reduced pain (2)
* Reduced reaction times on cognitive tasks (6)
* Reduced impulsivity (2)

**Right Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, Inhibitory**



* Reduced costly reciprocal fairness signaling (ultimatum game, dictator game, trade-back game with reputation) (3)
* Increased risk-taking behavior (2)

**Right Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, Excitatory**



* Reduced reaction times on cognitive tasks (4)
* Increased startle & distraction by threats (2)

 

**Bilateral Dorsomedial Prefrontal Cortex, Excitatory**



* Increased empathy and comfort with social interaction (3)
* Improved fear extinction/phobia recovery (2)

**Left Inferior Frontal Cortex, Inhibitory**



* Improved performance on abstract reasoning tasks such as syllogisms and artificial grammar (2)

**M1, Excitatory**



* Reduced pain (2)

**Right Temporoparietal Junction, Inhibitory**



* Reduced ingroup bias (2)

**Left Inferior Parietal Lobule, Excitatory**



* Improved reading accuracy (2)

**Right Inferior Parietal Lobule, Excitatory**



* Improved accuracy and reaction time on numerical estimation and calculation tasks (2)

**Right Inferior Parietal Lobule, Inhibitory**



* Shorter reaction time in bottom-up processing and visual perception tasks (4)
* Reduced startle response to pain and loud noises (2)
