This is Part 2  in our series of posts on types of treatments that might extend healthy lifespan.

**What are Fullerenes?**

Buckminsterfullerene is the chemical compound C60, composed of 60 carbon atoms structured as a truncated icosahedron.  Fullerenes and their derivatives (with hydroxyl or carboxyl groups attached) are strong antioxidants and may have life-extending or neuroprotective properties.

**C60**

In a 2012 French study, researchers looking for the toxicity of [60]-fullerene (carbon buckyballs) in rats instead found that an olive oil emulsion of buckyballs increased lifespan by 90%. 

This is the largest life-extension effect on rats from a chemical compound seen to date, and it comes from a chemical that’s very little studied in life extension.  There’s only one study of [60]-fullerene on lifespan. Until it replicates, it might well be a fluke.

**Carboxyfullerenes**

Laura Dugan’s lab at Vanderbilt University has been researching fullerenes rendered polar with the addition of carboxyl groups, and found that they have neuroprotective and lifespan-extending effects in mammals.

Mice treated with the carboxyfullerene C3 at 10 mg/kg daily lived 11% longer than control mice, they found, and also improved the performance of old mice on the Morris water maze (a test of cognition.)[2]

C3 has neuroprotective effects. It blocks the death of neurons in response to the neurotransmitter NMDA, the so-called “excitotoxic” response that causes brain damage as a result of inflammation or trauma.[3]

Macaque monkeys given MPTP poisoning (a model of Parkinson’s disease) treated for two months with either C3 or placebo developed motor symptoms only in the placebo group; the treated group had much lower (p = 0.007) Parkinsonian symptoms than the placebo group, as well as more striatal dopamine.[4]

C3 is a superoxide dismutase mimetic -- that is, it eliminates the free radical superoxide ( O_2-), and thus protects cells from damage. Fullerenes in general are more effective at protecting neurons from NMDA excitotoxicity the more strongly they react with superoxide.[5]  This is a plausible mechanism for how carboxyfullerenes might extend healthy lifespan -- they delay the onset of neurodegenerative diseases by reducing the damage to neurons from free radicals.

**Further Experiments**

It would be extremely valuable to independently confirm the C60 result.  It would also be useful to expand on the C3 results -- to do dose-response studies, test different treatment protocols, and test other measures of neurocognitive aging in mice.
