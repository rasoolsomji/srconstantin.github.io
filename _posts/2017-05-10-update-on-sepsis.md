title: Update on Sepsis
tags: [medicine, philanthropy]

Dr. Marik’s home university, EVMS, is currently raising money for an RCT of his [sepsis treatment](https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/04/09/sepsis-cure-needs-an-rct/).

You can donate as a private individual [here](https://giving.evms.edu/give_now_sepsis/).

Remember, the whole thing only costs $250,000 — a few people can make a significant dent in that.  The response from my preliminary survey was _great_, and we clearly have a lot of generous people interested in the sepsis issue.

For my own record-keeping, I’d appreciate it if people who saw this blog post and donated would fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_fqU7BoBHIYnW2_CKelHkcqzcAKmJwNSRUFqg-e5zjnX98w/viewform?usp=sf_link); I’d like to be able to congratulate my blog readers on our total amount raised.
