&lt;p&gt;The COVID19 crisis has caused a severe shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers. Masks, face shields, respirators, and other supplies help keep the people who care for COVID19 patients from getting sick themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s been a huge outpouring of effort to fix this shortage, by manufacturers, makers, donors, and volunteers. But as of yet, I haven’t seen anything approaching a comprehensive list of who is active in this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my best attempt at aggregating all the open-source designs for personal protective equipment (PPE), manufacturers and DIY maker groups currently scaling up their production of PPE, and coordination/distribution efforts to get PPE to the health care workers who need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a hardware engineer or experienced maker, so I have made no attempt to evaluate these designs myself. I do NOT vouch for the quality of any of these designs. I do mention when a design has already been in use in hospitals, been tested by medical professionals, been certified by a governing body, etc. The only designs I’m putting in the “Bad Ideas” section are those that I’ve seen specific criticism of (e.g. from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.helpfulengineering.org/&quot;&gt;Helpful Engineering &lt;/a&gt;team.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because I have not listed a design under “Bad Ideas” does not mean it is a good idea!  If you are considering manufacturing PPE, use your own critical judgment to choose a design!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, I have not vetted the charities on this list. I make no claims about their competence or integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Source Designs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little good news on the COVID-19 front: yes, you can kill the virus on surfaces, with easily available disinfectants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper surfaces, silver particles, alcohol-based disinfectants, and UV light will kill the virus.  Frequently touched items, especially in public places, should probably just be irradiated with UVC light and/or coated with copper as a routine prevention measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Regular UV light is an effective disinfectant but can also blind people and burn skin; UVC is a shorter wavelength, equally effective against microbes but not harmful to eyes or skin.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do Copper Surfaces Kill/Inactivate Coronaviruses?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an experiment with aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, at 21-23 degrees C and 40% humidity, both reached undetectable levels within 8 hours exposure to copper; by contrast, they lasted 72 hours on stainless steel and plastic.[1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H1N1 influenza, which was another pandemic virus, though not a coronavirus, lasted significantly less time on copper than stainless steel; 10^5 viable viruses after 24 hours on stainless steel vs. 10^2 viable viruses after 2 hours on copper.[2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human coronavirus 229E remains infectious on plastic, ceramic, glass, and stainless steel for at least 5 days, was inactivated in less than 5 minutes on copper and brass when applied dry, and inactivated in less than an hour when applied in solution to metal alloys containing &amp;gt;75% copper.[4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using copper-coated surfaces in real-world environments reduces microbial contamination. In 5 residential healthcare facilities, where half of the doorknobs and handrails were coated with copper alloys while half were not, the bacterial concentration was significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) lower on the copper-coated doorknobs and handrails.[5]  Similarly, when weights and grips in a gym were coated with copper alloy or left as rubber or stainless steel, the bacterial concentrations on the copper-coated surfaces were 94% lower than the controls.[6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silver Ion Zeolites as Anti-Microbial Surfaces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercially available silver zeolite powder (AgION powder, manufactured by Sinanen Co.) completely inactivated SARS-CoV at concentrations above 375 mg/L.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zeolites are fine, talc-like powders that can be incorporated into coatings to produce antimicrobial surfaces; the FDA has approved zeolites for use in food packaging.[3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disinfectants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study of 7 disinfectant liquids on the SARS coronavirus, including several with &amp;gt;80% ethanol as active ingredient, all of them significantly reduced SARS concentrations, by a factor of at least 1000.[7]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;70%+ ethanol was effective at reducing (by a factor of &amp;gt;1000) the infectivity of both SARS and MERS coronaviruses; so was 50%+ 2-propanol, hydrogen peroxide, glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, and povidone iodine. Chlorhexidine was not effective.[9]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study of human coronaviruses 229E and OC43, soap, bleach, and Proviodine (the active ingredient was iodine) all completely inactivated the viruses.[8]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Axe dishwashing detergent, sodium hypochlorite solution, and the disinfectant Virkon S, all killed SARS-CoV virus by a factor of at least 1000.[10]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against two coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus, a solution of 70% ethanol reduced viral infectivity by a factor of &amp;gt;1000; phenolic, sodium hypochlorite, and orthopthalaldehyde did not.[11]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UVC Radiation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exposure of SARS virus to UVC radiation for six minutes results in a 400-fold reduction in infectivity.  UVA and gamma radiation did not affect infectivity.[12]  Another study of SARS found 1000-fold inactivation from 15 minutes of exposure to UVC.[13]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study of Ebola virus and MERS virus found that UVC light at &amp;gt;0.1 J/cm^2 reduced infectivity more than 5000-fold in both.  Methylene blue plus light at &amp;gt;30 J/cm^2 also reduced infectivity 2000-fold in both.[14]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far-UVC light (207-222 nm) inactivates bacteria without harm to human skin.  It also reduces H1N1 infectivity by 100-fold at low doses: 2 mJ/cm^2.[15]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;222-nm far-UVC light applied to a mouse wound where MRSA bacteria had been spread reduced skin bacteria concentrations by &amp;gt;1000-fold, just like 254-nm conventional antimicrobial UV irradiation, but only the 254-nm light increased skin thickness significantly ( a measure of skin damage.)[16]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Should You Do For A Mild Case of COVID-19?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you, or someone in your household, has a flu-like or pneumonia-like illness that you suspect is COVID-19.  What can you do to increase your chances of getting well, and decrease your chances of getting sick enough to need a hospital?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This document doesn’t actually have a lot of answers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For respiratory infections not severe enough to need hospitalization, most medical guidelines advise identifying the pathogen, prescribing antivirals or antibiotics effective against that pathogen (we don’t know that much yet about which ones work for COVID-19), and otherwise practicing “supportive care” – rest, fluids, treating symptoms, avoiding infecting others.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supportive care often isn’t specified in studies, which is annoying, because it means we don’t have data on the effectiveness or potential disadvantages of over-the-counter medications to treat symptoms like fever and cough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this document, I am restricting attention to studies and reports of human subjects – no animal or in-vitro evidence – but I am including correlational evidence or even case reports, and I am including evidence from other diseases than COVID-19 where it seems that the result could translate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(For instance, I’m not including all the evidence about oseltamivir (Tamiflu) being effective against influenza, because it doesn’t seem to help with COVID-19; but I am including evidence about N-acetylcysteine preventing and reducing the severity of influenza, because NAC seems to work by generic immune-stimulatory effects rather than an effect specific to a particular virus.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to get tested by a doctor if you have a respiratory illness you think is COVID-19. Even if you can’t get access to a COVID-19 test, you might also have a different bacterial or viral infection (either instead of or in addition to COVID-19) which is treatable by antivirals or antibiotics. It’s very common for viral pneumonia to be complicated by an opportunistic bacterial infection, and killing the bacteria can help improve outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms of Mild COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common symptoms of mild COVID-19 are fever, cough, fatigue and muscle pain, and headache.  Other symptoms include sore throat, difficulty breathing, diarrhea, chest tightness, fear of cold, and sputum production.[1][2][4] Rash on the limbs is also possible.[3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rest and Fluids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like with any mild illness, public health departments are advising patients who have mild COVID-19 to get rest and drink fluids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t find experimental evidence for this but it makes sense and can’t hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanitation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WHO’s recommendations for home care for mild COVID-19 cases are primarily about avoiding infection for caregivers; patients should be in their own, well-ventilated room if possible, caregivers should wear masks and clean &amp;amp; disinfect surfaces daily, etc.[5]  There is no mention of how to optimize for recovery of the patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid Ibuprofen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France’s health minister has counseled patients with mild COVID-19 not to use ibuprofen or other NSAIDs to treat symptoms, after four young patients with the disease developed severe symptoms after using NSAIDs.  Patients were advised to take paracetamol instead.[6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid Corticosteroids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corticosteroids were associated with increased mortality and viral shedding in H1N1 viral pneumonia.[8]  Corticosteroids increased viral load in SARS.[11]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favipiravir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an open-label study, COVID-19 patients who took favipiravir had on average a shorter course of disease (4 days vs 12 days, p &amp;lt; 0.001) than those who took a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir.  All patients in the study also received interferon-alpha1b by aerosol inhalation, rehydration, electrolytes, antipyretics, analgesics, and antiemetics.[7]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a non-randomized study of 36 patients with COVID-19 treated with placebo, hydroxychloroquine, or hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine had a significantly higher rate of virological cure (p &amp;lt; 0.001) than placebo.  By day 6, 70% of hydroxychloroquine patients were cured, compared to 20% with placebo. With azithromycin + hydroxychloroquine, 100% of patients were cured by day 5.[10]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a Chinese study (reported by Bloomberg [12] because it’s in Chinese) of 30 patients given hydroxychloroquine or placebo found no difference in the rate of cure between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N-Acetylcysteine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a randomized trial of 262 elderly patients, assigned to N-acetylcysteine or placebo for 6 months, NAC significantly (p&amp;lt;0.01) reduced the incidence of influenza-like episodes, and significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.001) reduced the incidence of headache, muscle soreness, sore throat, and cough. In the NAC group, 25% of serologically confirmed H1N1 influenza cases were symptomatic, compared to 79% in the placebo group.[9]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air Quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a retrospective study in Utah hospitals, high concentrations of particulate matter in the air were associated with slightly but significantly higher (OR = 1.004) rates of admission to the emergency room for pneumonia, and slightly (OR = 1.02) but significantly higher rates of pneumonia mortality.[12] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having air filters in the home may be slightly protective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have a lot of planned COVID-19 lit review posts, but I’m going to take a quick break and go back to my sequence on psychology/cognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might recall that in &lt;a href=&quot;https://srconstantin.github.io/2020/02/21/tangled-thinking-1.html&quot;&gt;the first post in this sequence&lt;/a&gt; I laid out a framework where the content of our conscious minds is made up of &lt;strong&gt;mental objects&lt;/strong&gt;, much of what we do when we think, act, or perceive is a process of reconciling (apparent) &lt;strong&gt;conflicts&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;contradictions&lt;/strong&gt; between our mental objects, and &lt;strong&gt;suffering&lt;/strong&gt; is what we experience when we actively &lt;em&gt;refuse&lt;/em&gt; to resolve a contradiction or indeed deny its existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://srconstantin.github.io/2020/02/24/tangled-thinking-2.html&quot;&gt;second post&lt;/a&gt; I talked about &lt;strong&gt;motivated cognition&lt;/strong&gt;, which is defined as being motivated to have certain &lt;em&gt;beliefs&lt;/em&gt; rather than being motivated to achieve certain outcomes “out there” in the world. And I clarified that the problem with motivated cognition isn’t that people have motives, but that they’re in a sense motivated &lt;em&gt;about the wrong things&lt;/em&gt; – that it’s dysfunctional to turn your optimization power inward (believing things because you want to believe them) rather than outward (doing things because you want to do them.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That raises some new questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, how does motivated cognition (optimizing for what &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; mental experiences you want to have) relate to suffering (refusing to resolve contradictions)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, what do we even mean by internal vs. external?  Isn’t that kind of dualist? Why is it good to optimize for what you want to achieve in the external world, but bad to optimize for what kinds of internal mental states you want to have? A priori this isn’t a really principled distinction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can resolve both questions at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Out in the real world”, we saw in &lt;a href=&quot;https://srconstantin.github.io/2020/02/21/tangled-thinking-1.html&quot;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, from a subjective perspective, really just means “consistent with the experiences, mental objects, phenomena, etc, that I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; have, but haven’t had yet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t know anything, &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;, about the things I’m still ignorant of, by definition. Those are things that are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; currently mental objects in my mind. They are not in my model.  They are outside my current cognitive “world.”  The unknown. The out-of-frame. The unmapped Universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if I believe in the Universe, I believe that &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; I encounter these new, out-of-model, surprising things, I will eventually be able to reconcile them with all the &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; mental objects in my subjective “world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I am “optimizing for a state of reality”, or “having preferences about reality”, the things I have preferences about are still mental objects – mental objects are all I have subjective access to!  BUT, I am trying to achieve a setup of these mental objects that will &lt;em&gt;survive&lt;/em&gt; new discoveries, new data, ontology shifts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I try to fool myself, usually the false belief is &lt;em&gt;fragile&lt;/em&gt;. There is some new data I must not acquire because it would destabilize the belief. If I want to believe I can still make the train, I have to not check my watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what it means to not be optimizing for reality; you’re optimizing your subjective world in a fragile way, that would collapse completely if you explored even a little bit in the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Oscar Wilde said, “Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s actually a surprisingly deep statement. The delicacy, the fragility, is what &lt;em&gt;makes&lt;/em&gt; it ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it bad to try to be ignorant?  Well, “bad” may be the wrong word for it, but by our earlier definition of “suffering”, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; predict that some new discovery will ruin your desired mental state, and therefore that you must not look over there, then you already have something in your field of consciousness that is ruining or conflicting with your desired mental state.  But you’re trying to believe that it’s not &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt; ruining anything, so long as you don’t look at it. That’s having an internal contradiction and trying not to resolve it. That’s suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s anything in the world that you &lt;em&gt;remember&lt;/em&gt; not to pay attention to because it’ll upset you – let’s say you never read anything by a particular author – then, at the moment you choose to look away from the upsetting thing, you &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; have a thing that upsets you. The upsetting thing may not be, itself, the actual author you choose not to read; it may be your memory or impression of that author, or a thought you had once while reading that author, or something else. But if you are capable of thinking “ew, I won’t read that, it’ll just upset me” then you &lt;em&gt;have a thing that upsets you right now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you are &lt;em&gt;confused&lt;/em&gt; about how your mind works, and you think that you are actually &lt;em&gt;sparing&lt;/em&gt; yourself upset by avoiding the author.  You think that this state you’re in now – where you’re going “ew, that’ll upset me” – is what not being upset feels like.  But you’re wrong! This is actually an upset state.  This is a state of internal conflict, RIGHT NOW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean the “right” (anti-suffering) thing to do is to push through and read the article anyway.  The “right” thing to do would be to interrogate your &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; state of upset or inner conflict, see what’s going on there, try to resolve or dissolve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you don’t always have time to do that in practice; it takes time to “untangle” your thoughts, and if you untangled literally everything as it came up, you’d be spending a colossal amount of time in silent contemplation, and sometimes life wants us to respond faster than that. Although I suspect that perhaps if you actually did that colossal amount of contemplation, you’d eventually get faster at the untangling process, and also get rid of the “backlog” of unresolved inner conflicts you’re carrying around, so that afterwards you could deal with the world more or less in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what’s going on when we suffer. We think we are avoiding things that could hurt us, but we are actually &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; hurting, and stubbornly refusing to salve our present hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noticing More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The macho/stoic “just lean into the discomfort” thing is exactly the reverse of this cognitive-resolution perspective. It sounds similar, in that it also says “avoidance and denial is bad”, but it’s going in exactly the opposite direction.  It says to &lt;em&gt;override&lt;/em&gt; your sensitivities, rather than to become &lt;em&gt;so much more&lt;/em&gt; sensitive that you notice and fix the subtler aversions that come &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; whatever you’re currently avoiding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get good at noticing the subtle stuff, you’ll see that there are specific, discrete, but kinda…stupid? mental objects that are present in your mind.  They’re “stupid” in that, they’re usually nonverbal, and they’re kind of like the cells in DeepDream, they’re sort of shaped like one &lt;em&gt;component&lt;/em&gt; of a sense memory. “The way this shadow of a roof beam fell across the room one time on a middle school retreat in the woods, and the sharp smell of bug spray, and the way I had a vague sense of being unprepared to deal with physically challenging activities and being creeped out by the Evangelical Christian mottoes everywhere.”  Except that’s one single “note”, one brain-phenomenon, and it gets activated when I think about “why do I feel resistant to doing physically uncomfortable things like jumping into freezing cold water?”  I feel like “but ugh, [THIS]” where THIS is the roof-beam-shadow-in-the-lodge thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s how a big chunk of thoughts are &lt;em&gt;actually shaped&lt;/em&gt;, at least in my experience; we may just not talk about them because it sounds too weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I wonder sometimes if dealing with the “associative receptor field” or “emotional-sense-memory basis element” level of thought is actually what needs to happen to resolve a bunch of stuff and actually know what your mind is doing and reprogram it if you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance.  Why am I not going out for a run today? Well, I have a &lt;em&gt;memory&lt;/em&gt; – a snapshot sense-memory – of one time five years ago when I tried going out for a run when I was out of shape, and I was really embarrassed and humiliated; my throat was burning and I was almost in tears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would I feel that same way if I went running now? I don’t know. The road outside my door today looks different than that road in New Haven, the weather is different, I’m different, so maybe my experience will be different.  Intellectually that seems clear. But the loudest “note” in my mind is that full-body memory of it sucking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really think the &lt;em&gt;mechanics&lt;/em&gt; of why I’m not making the decision to go for that run are at the “evoked full-body memory” level of granularity.  It seems kind of…arrogant? to think I can just detect that; outside view, nobody is very good at understanding their “subconscious”, and fake-epiphanies where people think they can intentionally rewrite “subconscious” patterns (but they actually can’t) are a dime a dozen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don’t have the sense that I have mastered self-reprogramming, at all; I just have the sense that I know &lt;em&gt;where my decisions are coming from&lt;/em&gt;, and they’re these memory-fragments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, a thing is obviously not “subconscious” if you can &lt;em&gt;literally experience it in consciousness.&lt;/em&gt; I suspect that a lot of what people call “subconscious” is totally available to attention, just stuff that we expect ourselves not to attend to, especially because we don’t normally talk to &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; people about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could it be that attending to &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; internal phenomena is actually a “spiritual path” or a “self-improvement path” or whatever? There’s &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much more attention paid to overriding internal phenomena than exploring them; maybe most people know something I don’t, or maybe there’s a really persistent bias in the world of psychological advice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="tangled-thinking" /><category term="cog-psych" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How Effective is Non-Invasive Ventilation in COVID-19?</title><link href="/2020/03/22/non-invasive-ventilation.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How Effective is Non-Invasive Ventilation in COVID-19?" /><published>2020-03-22T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-03-22T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>/2020/03/22/non-invasive-ventilation</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2020/03/22/non-invasive-ventilation.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/totalfacemask.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cpapman&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does non-invasive ventilation even work in critically ill COVID-19 patients?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last post in this blog discussed whether non-invasive ventilation (NIV) can be effective in acute respiratory failure for any cause, and examined only randomized controlled trials of the intervention.  But is COVID-19 different?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There aren’t any controlled experimental trials of non-invasive ventilation for COVID-19 or related coronaviruses, so for this post we’ve had to look at retrospective observational studies. The evidence is weaker here. But it still looks like NIV can be helpful, at least in a large fraction of cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVID-19: Experiences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a retrospective analysis of 191 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in two hospitals in Wuhan, China, 41 received high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy; 33 (80%) of those died. 26 patients received non-invasive mechanical ventilation; 24 (92%) of those died. Finally, 32 received invasive mechanical ventilation; 31 (97%) of those died.  This was not a statistically significant difference between the survival rates of different respiratory support techniques.[1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a retrospective study of 60 severe COVID-19 patients from Jiangsu Province, China, 16 patients (26.7%) had respiratory failure. 14 patients received non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV), 15 received high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), 6 received both NIV and HFNC, and 3 received invasive mechanical ventilation.  14 (93%) of the HFNC patients improved; 9 (64%) of the NIV patients improved; this is not a statistically significant difference.  3 patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation; the paper did not list which therapies they had previously failed.[2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A retrospective on 631 patients in Jiangsu Province, China, reports that they were able to keep the rate of invasive mechanical ventilation under 1%, far below the Chinese average, despite a 10% rate of critically ill patients, by continuously monitoring high-risk patients and placing them on NIV or HFNC.[3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a retrospective of 53 critically ill COVID-19 patients from Wuhan, 33 were treated with HFNC and 52% survived; 29 were placed on NIV and 26% survived; and 22 were placed on invasive ventilation and 14% survived.  Of those placed on NIV, 48% had to be placed on invasive ventilation.[4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a preliminary (not-peer-reviewed) retrospective of 45 critically ill patients from Guangdong Province, China, with COVID-19, 6 (13.3%) were treated with standard oxygen therapy, 13 (28.9%) were treated with HNFC, 6 (13.3%) with NIV (all on a BiPAP), and 20 (44.4%) with invasive mechanical ventilation. Only one patient (2.2%) died in this cohort, compared to 62% in Wuhan. No patients treated with non-invasive oxygen therapies needed to be intubated.[5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a retrospective study of 267 confirmed COVID-19 patients from Chongqing Municipality, China, 5 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, 35 received non-invasive ventilation, 12 received HFNC, and 91 patients received standard oxygen therapy.  4 (1.5%) patients died in the entire study. All 50 patients with severe disease received oxygen, and all 50 needed further respiratory therapy; 2/35, or 5.7%, of patients on non-invasive ventilation needed to be intubated.[6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions Based on COVID-19 Published Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been no controlled studies of non-invasive ventilation for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a total of 70 COVID-19 patients, from three Chinese studies, treated with non-invasive ventilation, 23% needed to be intubated.  This is well within the range of failure of NIV for other causes of acute respiratory failure, and leaves it as an option that can still work in the majority of cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a total of 90 patients treated with HFNC, 56% died; in a total of 69 patients treated with NIV, 72% died; in a total of 54 patients treated with invasive ventilation, 93% died.  There is no statistically significant difference in the death rates between groups. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WHO’s clinical guidelines [7] on the use of NIV and HFNC in COVID-19 are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) should only be used in selected patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) should only be used in selected patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Patients treated with either HFNO or NIV should be closely monitored for clinical deterioration. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remark 1: Adult HFNO systems can deliver 60 L/min of gas flow and FiO2 up to 1.0. Paediatric circuits generally only handle up to 25 L/min, and many children will require an adult circuit to deliver adequate flow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remark 2: Due to uncertainty around the potential for aerosolization, HFO, NIV, including bubble CPAP, should be used with airborne precautions until further evaluation of the safety can be completed.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remark 3: Compared with standard oxygen therapy, HFNO reduces the need for intubation (42). Patients with hypercapnia (exacerbation of obstructive lung disease, cardiogenic pulmonary oedema), hemodynamic instability, multiorgan failure, or abnormal mental status should generally not receive HFNO, although emerging data suggest that HFNO may be safe in patients with mild-moderate and non-worsening hypercapnia (42, 43, 44). Patients receiving HFNO should be in a monitored setting and cared for by experienced personnel capable of endotracheal intubation in case the patient acutely deteriorates or does not improve after a short trial (about 1 hour). Evidence-based guidelines on HFNO do not exist, and reports on HFNO in other coronavirus-infected patients are limited (44).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much is known about the use of NIV and HFNO in COVID-19.  If possible, patients being given these therapies should be monitored in case they fail and the patient needs to be urgently intubated. However, what little evidence we have is in line with the results from other severe pulmonary diseases like pneumonia: in a majority of cases, non-invasive respiratory therapy can suffice and invasive mechanical ventilation can be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SARS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among 1512 patients with SARS in Guangdong Province, China, there were 58 deaths, for a case fatality rate of 3.8%, the lowest in the world. The author attributes this success to prompt treatment with corticosteroids and, in 20-30% of cases, with non-invasive ventilation (usually with a CPAP mask.)[8]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Hong Kong case series of SARS patients, non-invasive ventilation was reported to be able to avoid intubation in ⅔ of patients.[9]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a retrospective study of two hospitals in Hong Kong, one which used non-invasive ventilation with a BiPAP and one which only used invasive ventilation for SARS, 21.4% out of 42 patients needed to be intubated at the NIV hospital compared to 41.2% out of 451 patients at the invasive-ventilation hospital, a significant (p = 0.012) reduction in the need for intubation.  Also, the mortality rate was lower (9.5% vs 25.1%, p = 0.024) in the NIV hospital. Only 8/21 (38%) of NIV-treated patients needed to be intubated.  No healthcare workers acquired SARS at the NIV hospital.[10]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a meta-analysis of 4 studies comprising 96 SARS patients treated with NIV, the non-invasive ventilation treatment failed in a total of 51 patients, or 53%.[11]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In 17 studies of patients with H1N1 influenza comprising 551 patients treated with NIV, 338 or 61% failed the treatment.  The paper summarizes the use of NIV in H1N1 as follows: “NIV has a role in the management of early respiratory failure due to pH1N1 infection; however, in a strictly controlled environment with close monitoring of healthcare workers and with adequate precautions for prevention of infection transmission. NIV has no role in severe respiratory failure and ARDS related to severe pH1N1 infection.” [11]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 32 critically ill healthcare workers with MERS, 13 received NIV and 26 received invasive ventilation; that is, 7/13, or 54%, of patients treated with NIV failed and needed to be intubated. [12] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In COVID-19 and in other coronavirus epidemics (SARS and MERS), non-invasive ventilation significantly reduces the need for intubation. In the case of SARS, NIV has been shown to significantly reduce mortality as well. In these viruses, NIV has high failure rates – 20-60%, depending on the disease – so ideally it should be closely monitored in case the patient needs to be intubated. However, NIV succeeds often enough that it makes sense to use it for critically ill patients when invasive ventilation is not an option. (Some patients have a Do Not Intubate order, for instance.)  We don’t know much yet about how well it works in COVID-19, and there are no randomized studies, but from what little evidence we have, it seems that there’s a sizable proportion of patients who can benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula are treatments for acute respiratory failure, including in severe cases of viral pneumonia such as COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are reputed to be risky techniques that spread the virus, and are banned in many hospitals for the treatment of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We might ask some questions about this. Where is the evidence that non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and high-flow nasal cannula therapy (HFNC) spread viral particulates or droplets?  How far does this spread go?  And where on the mask does the spread come from?  (Could better masks that don’t cause this spread be designed?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at some of the literature on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 5-person study of high flow nasal cannula usage, in which the participants gargled with food dye and coughed, with and without wearing a well-fitting HFNC mask, cough-generated droplets spread to a mean (standard deviation) distance of 2.48 (1.03) m at baseline and 2.91 (1.09) m with HFNC. A maximum cough distance of 4.50 m was reported when using HFNC.  A separate study found that non-cough droplets extended a maximum of 62 cm when using HFNC. High-flow nasal cannula usage does spray cough droplets farther, by 0.42 m on average, than baseline.[1] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While HFNC can spread the virus farther than baseline, and farther than the 2-meter separation that’s the recommended minimum distance between COVID-19 patients in a hospital, it is unlikely to spread droplets from one room to another, for instance, through wall vents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive ventilation has been reported to increase the risk of viral transmission to healthcare workers in the case of SARS, but so did invasive ventilation.  Oxygen therapy and NIV can disperse air up to 1M around the patient.[2]  Again, this is not enough for virus particles to travel from room to room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study of 628 healthcare workers treating patients with severe SARS, presence in the room during non-invasive ventilation (p &amp;lt; 0.01), intubation (p &amp;lt; 0.01), and manual ventilation before intubation (p = 0.02) were independently associated with increased risk of healthcare workers contracting SARS; in a multivariate model, the only one of these procedures that stayed significant was intubation (OR = 2.79, p = 0.004).  Non-invasive ventilation and manual (bag mask) ventilation may be able to spread disease to healthcare workers, but no more so than intubation.[3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an experiment with noninvasive ventilation (BiPAP) with an oronasal face mask, on a dummy with a realistic model of human respiration, marking the air with smoke particles exhaled through the “airway”, smoke was found to leak from the mask through the six small exhaust holes on the nasal bridge of the mask.  The smoke leaked a maximum of 0.45 M away from the dummy.[4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study comparing non-invasive ventilation in normal subjects, subjects with cold symptoms, and subjects with infective exacerbations of chronic lung disease, NIV produced large (&amp;gt;10 um) droplets in the chronic lung disease and cold patients, but did not produce an aerosol. Due to the large size of droplets, most fall onto surfaces within 1M of the patient. Again, while healthcare workers are at risk (and need to wear personal protective equipment while treating patients with NIV) it is unlikely that NIV could send particulates into surrounding rooms.[5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study sampling the air around 39 H1N1 influenza patients after various procedures, noninvasive ventilation was not associated with a significantly increased risk of finding H1N1 RNA in the air.[6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is room for doubt, given the evidence, whether non-invasive ventilation in fact spreads virus particles to healthcare workers.  There is no evidence at all that particulates from non-invasive ventilation masks can spread more than a few meters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This matters because, in the event of a shortage of ICU beds and mechanical ventilators, if a device that can be used at home can reduce a COVID-19 patient’s risk of needing to be hospitalized, it could save potentially millions of lives in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at a total of 19 randomized controlled trials, comprising 3979 patients in all, which directly compared either a type of non-invasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula therapy, or both to standard oxygen therapy, for adult patients with acute respiratory failure who had not received surgery or intubation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a t-test to compare the risk of intubation between treatments, I found that there was a 15% rate of intubation in the non-invasive ventilation (NIV) group vs. a 30% rate of intubation in the standard therapy group, for a significant (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) difference in intubation risk; the NIV group had half the odds of failing and needing intubation, compared with standard oxygen mask therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, there was a significant (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) difference in the mortality risk; the NIV group had a mortality risk of 15% at follow-up, while the standard treatment group had a mortality rate of 24%, a relative risk of 0.625.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no significant reduction in risk of mortality or intubation between standard and high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When restricted to studies of community-acquired pneumonia, NIV still significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) reduces risk of intubation and significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) reduces the risk of mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Invasive Ventilation Vs. Standard Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an RCT of 236 patients admitted to the hospital for exacerbations of COPD, randomized to either standard treatment or non-invasive ventilation (NIV), NIV was associated with a reduced (RR = 0.56, p = 0.038) risk of needing intubation.[1]  Even in the NIV group, 15% of patients still needed intubation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a randomized study of 82 elderly patients with chronic pulmonary disease, randomized to receive NIV or standard therapy, the patients receiving NIV had a 7.3% chance of needing intubation, while the patients on standard (oxygen) therapy had a 63% chance; this is a significant difference (RR  = 0.11, p &amp;lt; 0.001).  The mortality rate at one year was also significantly lower in the NIV group (RR = 0.83, p = 0.014).[3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study (the 3CPO trial)  of 1069 patients with severe cardiogenic pulmonary edema, randomized to CPAP, non-invasive ventilation, or standard oxygen therapy, there was no significant difference in the rate of mortality (9.8% vs 9.5%) or intubation (2.8% vs 2.9%) between groups.[4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a randomized multicenter study over 19 hospitals in China, patients given NIV for exacerbations of COPD were much less likely than patients given standard therapy, (4% vs 15%, RR = 0.13, p = 0.002) but there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality.[5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a randomized study of 40 patients with acute lung injury, assigned either NIV or standard oxygen therapy, the proportion of patients requiring intubation was much lower in the NIV group (5% vs 37%: RR = 0.14, p = 0.02) and there was a nonsignificant trent (p = 0.09) towards lower mortality in the NIV group.[6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a randomized study of 40 patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, assigned to either NIV or standard oxygen therapy, intubation was required in fewer patients in the NIV group (5% vs 33%, RR = 0.15, p = 0.037).[7]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study of 85 patients with acute exacerbations of COPD, randomized to standard therapy or noninvasive ventilation, significantly fewer of the NIV patients (26% vs 74%, RR = 35%, p &amp;lt; 0.001) were intubated.  NIV patients also had fewer complications, shorter hospital stays, and lower in-hospital mortality (9% vs 29%, RR = 0.31, p =0.02).[9]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a randomized study of 105 patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, randomized to NIV or standard oxygen therapy, NIV reduced the need for intubation (13% vs 29%, RR = 0.45, p = 0.01) and ICU mortality (9% vs 21%, RR = 0.42, p = 0.028).[13]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the FLORALI trial, which randomized 310 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure to high-flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNC), non-invasive ventilation, or standard oxygen therapy through a nonrebreather mask, there was no significant difference in intubation rate between the three groups; but in the patient subgroup with the worst blood oxygenation levels, the high-flow oxygen group had a significantly lower intubation rate (35% vs 53%, RR = 0.66, p = 0.009).  Mortality at 90 days was also significantly lower in the high-flow nasal cannula group (12% vs 23%, RR = 0.52, p= 0.02).[14]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the HOT-ER trial of 302 patients with hypoxia and tachypnea presenting to an emergency department, randomly assigned to standard oxygen therapy or HFNC therapy, there was no significant difference between mortality and intubation rates, but this may have been because both groups had low rates of intubation (0.6% and 2.2%) and in-hospital mortality (9.1% and 8.0%).[15]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the HIGH trial of 776 adult immunocompromised patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, randomized to HFNC or standard oxygen, there was no significant difference between groups in mortality at day 28 (35.6% vs 36.1%) or intubation rate (38.7% vs 43.6%).[17]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a trial of 376 immunocompromised patients, mostly with cancer, randomized to either non-invasive ventilation or standard oxygen therapy, there was no significant difference in intubation rates between the two groups (24.1% vs 27.3%) and no significant difference in 28-day mortality (24.1% vs 27.3%)[19]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a randomized study of 31 patients with acute respiratory failure, randomized to non-invasive ventilation or standard oxygen, significantly fewer patients in the NIV group needed intubation (31% vs 73%, RR = 0.42, p = 0.03), but there was no significant difference in mortality.[20]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 52 immunosuppressed patients with acute respiratory distress, pulmonary infiltrates, and fever, randomized either to NIV or standard oxygen, fewer patients in the NIV group required intubation (46% vs 76%, RR = 0.6, p = 0.03) and fewer patients in the NIV died in the hospital (50% vs 81%, RR= 0.58, p = 0.02).[21]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a randomized study of 60 patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, assigned to CPAP, BIPAP, or standard oxygen, patients assigned to CPAP were more likely to survive to hospital discharge (100% vs 70 % vs 75%, p = 0.02).  There was no difference in the number of patients needing intubation: (20% vs 5% vs 5%).[22]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an Indian study of 40 patients with acute exacerbations of COPD randomized to NIV or standard oxygen, the NIV group had a lower rate of intubation (15% vs 60%, RR = 0.25, p = 0.003) but there was no significant difference in hospital mortality (15% vs 20%).[23]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pneumonia-Specific Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a randomized study of 56 cases of severe pneumonia, assigned to NIV (with a CPAP mask) or standard oxygen therapy, significantly fewer patients in the NIV group (21% vs 61%, RR = 34%, p = 0.007) met criteria for intubation.  There was no significant difference in hospital death rates or 2-month survival rates.[8]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a randomized study of 81 patients with acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia, randomized to NIV with a CPAP or standard oxygen therapy with a Venturi mask, significantly fewer from the CPAP group met criteria for intubation (15% vs 63%, RR = 0.24, p &amp;lt; 0.001), and the CPAP group showed a faster and greater oxygenation response.[12]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of Non-Invasive Ventilation Compared&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a meta-analysis comprising 290 patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, there was no significant difference in either hospital mortality or intubation risk between CPAP and BIPAP machines. [2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 36 patients with acute hypercapnic pulmonary edema randomized to either non-invasive pressure support ventilation or CPAP, there was no significant difference in intubation rates or mortality rates.[18]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 83 women with ARDS randomized to NIV either with a face mask or a helmet, the rate of intubation was significantly lower with the helmet (18% vs 63%, RR = 0.29, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and the 90-day mortality rate was also significantly lower (34% vs 56%, RR= 0.6, p = 0.02).  The helmet may be more effective because it prevents air leak.[16]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Out-of-Hospital Non-Invasive Ventilation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a randomized study of 54 patients with acute respiratory failure given standard oxygen therapy or NIV by paramedics, significantly fewer of the NIV patients needed to go to the ICU (36% vs 65%, RR = 0.55, p &amp;lt; 0.05) and there was a nonsignificant trend towards fewer NIV patients needing to be intubated (4% vs 23%, p = 0.1) [10]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Past Pandemics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20-30% of patients with respiratory failure due to H1N1 influenza were given NIV, but 70-80% of those later needed intubation and invasive ventilation.[11]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the SARS outbreak, a Hong Kong hospital that treated patients with respiratory failure through non-invasive ventilation first had 21% of patients need invasive mechanical ventilation, while 41% of SARS patients in a ventilation-first hospital were on mechanical ventilation.  Mortality was also lower in the NIV hospital: 9.5% vs 25.1%.[24]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like, for acute respiratory distress in general and pneumonia specifically, non-invasive ventilation can help prevent it from getting so bad that intubation is necessary.  NIV reduces both intubation risk and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that, in a world where ICUs are overrun, there’s a good chance that a home non-invasive ventilation device could save lives for people with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we have correlational evidence that non-invasive ventilation can work for acute respiratory failure outside a hospital setting, and can reduce mortality in a past coronavirus epidemic (SARS). This points in favor of the possibility of non-invasive ventilation being useful in COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because non-invasive ventilation aerosolizes the virus, it is not safe in hospital settings, where it could spread COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone has the option of going to a hospital in the event of severe respiratory failure due to COVID-19, it’s better to go immediately than to try to self-treat at home; intubation can’t be done safely by an untrained person, and about 40% of severe COVID-19 cases require intubation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if hospitals are unavailable, as seems quite likely if the US doesn’t drastically increase its supply of medical personnel and equipment, a home non-invasive ventilation device may be a distinct improvement over either home oxygen supplementation or, obviously, no treatment at all.&lt;/p&gt;

There is a shortage of mechanical ventilators in hospitals, and a shortage of medical personnel to treat patients with severe COVID-19, so there’s widespread interest in contributing to open source ventilation projects. For these efforts to be effective, though, we need to understand what COVID-19 patients need in terms of ventilators and other supplemental oxygen sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVID-19 Symptoms and Clinical Guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most patients who go to a hospital for COVID-19 have pneumonia or infection of the lungs, which is visible on a chest X-ray.  A large fraction (41.3%) receive supplemental oxygen therapy; a smaller fraction (5%) needed to be admitted to the ICU, and 6.1% needed mechanical ventilation.[1] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARDS&lt;/strong&gt; 
Severe cases of COVID-19 result in developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Fluid builds up in the lungs; the lungs may collapse; blood oxygen drops; and mechanical ventilation is required. Merely providing air with a higher oxygen content than room air isn’t enough; pressure needs to be administered to keep the alveoli open.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxygen Therapy: Bag Mask&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bagvalvemask.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bagvalvemask&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bag valve mask is used in emergencies and for temporary ventilation while preparing for intubation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1goz1l28kUQ&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a doctor demonstrating how to use a bag valve mask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxygen Therapy: Nasal Cannulas and Simple Masks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/nasalcannula.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;nasalcannula&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/simplefacemask.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;simplefacemask&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a patient has difficulty getting enough oxygen but can breathe on their own, they get oxygen therapy. That is, they’re given a supply of air with an increased concentration of oxygen, but without any additional pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oxygen can be administered non-invasively through a nasal cannula or a simple mask. This can safely be done outside a hospital setting.  Oxygen concentrators are standard to keep in the home for people with chronic lung conditions like emphysema and COPD. Simple oxygen masks are regularly used by non-medical rescue personnel like firefighters and lifeguards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxygen Concentrators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To produce a supply of filtered, high-oxygen air from room air, you need an oxygen concentrator, which removes nitrogen from the air through filters. This oxygen-enriched air can then be provided to the patient through a mask or nasal cannula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home oxygen concentrators are available with a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oxygen Therapy: Non-Rebreather Masks
A non-rebreather mask is an oxygen mask with a sealed bag that prevents inhalation of room air or previously exhaled air, which allows for higher concentrations of oxygen to be administered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxygen Therapy: High Flow Nasal Cannula&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/HFNC.png&quot; alt=&quot;HFNC&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high flow nasal cannula provides a higher flow of oxygen, and warms and humidifies it, so that it is less irritating to mucous membranes and easier for the patient to breathe.  The higher flow also increases ventilation and causes the patient to rebreathe less exhaled air, which increases ventilation (the elimination of CO2).  It also provides a small amount of PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure, keeping the alveoli open) which can be helpful for patients whose lungs are collapsing due to respiratory failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-flow nasal cannulas will aerosolize the COVID-19 virus, infecting everyone nearby. They are not allowed in hospitals for COVID-19 because they spread disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noninvasive Ventilation: CPAP and BIPAP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/CPAP.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CPAP&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/BIPAP.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;BIPAP&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CPAP machines keep the patient’s airway open by forcing air continuously through a mask.  It is usually used for sleep apnea and other conditions that cause difficulty breathing.  The patient must initiate all breaths, but has additional pressure support to keep the airway and alveoli open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIPAP machines work the same way, except that they have two pressure settings instead of just one: a higher pressure for inhalation and a lower one for exhalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIPAPs and CPAPs can be used safely at home and don’t need medical supervision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like high-flow nasal cannulas, CPAP and BIPAP machines aerosolize the COVID-19 virus and are an infection risk for everyone nearby.  They are not allowed in hospitals for COVID-19; they will spread disease.  (Source: doctor interview.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invasive Mechanical Ventilation for ARDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the alveoli can’t stay open on their own, supplemental oxygen isn’t enough; this is when the patient needs to be intubated and placed on a ventilator that can provide enough pressure to keep the airway and alveoli open, so gas exchange can occur and the blood can be oxygenated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pressure on a mechanical ventilator needs to be precisely calibrated to the patient. Too much pressure and the lung can tear; too little, and the patient’s blood will fill with CO2 and not get enough oxygen. This is one reason why patients need to be placed on ventilators by trained experts (typically ICU nurses, doctors, and respiratory therapists). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason is that intubation is an invasive procedure; an endotracheal tube is inserted into the airway, which requires sedatives and anaesthetics to avoid pain and the gag reflex. Mistakes with aiming the tube or dosing the medications could cause permanent injury or death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/laryngoscope.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;laryngoscope&quot; height=&quot;250px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t want an untrained person sticking this blade down someone’s throat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Effective Is Outpatient Oxygen Therapy or Noninvasive Ventilation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple projects underway to produce open-source oxygen therapy or non-invasive ventilation devices for COVID-19. Are these projects actually useful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re not going to be used in hospitals, because of the risk that they’ll spread infection.  But could they still be useful for patients self-quarantining at home, in a context where ICU beds and ventilators are scarce?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, how often do patients who need non-invasive ventilation go on to need invasive ventilation, how long does it take before they need to escalate to invasive ventilation, and how helpful is non-invasive ventilation in preventing the need for invasive ventilation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 310 patients with acute respiratory failure in ICUs (typically due to pneumonia), randomized to standard oxygen therapy in a nonrebreather mask, oxygen therapy in a high flow nasal cannula, or noninvasive ventilation, there was no significant difference in the intubation rate (30-40% needed intubation within 4 days).  However, the high-flow oxygen group had a significantly lower 90-day mortality rate than the other two groups: 7% of the high-flow oxygen group died within 90 days, compared to 28% on standard oxygen and 23% on non-invasive ventilation.  The high-flow oxygen group also had significantly better blood oxygenation and spent fewer days on ventilators than the other two groups.[3]  High-flow nasal cannulas were also more effective than conventional oxygen masks at avoiding the need for repeated ventilation, in another randomized trial.[4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, suppose you’re a person with respiratory failure, but you have an oxygen mask, CPAP, BIPAP, or high-flow nasal cannula at home. 40% of the time or so, your noninvasive home equipment is going to fail and you’ll need to be intubated. Usually this happens quite urgently; if you need to take an ambulance to get to the hospital it might be too late.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since NIV (noninvasive ventilation) does not significantly reduce the risk of needing intubation, it’s strictly inferior to have people on NIV at home (where they may not be able to get to a doctor in time if their condition worsens) than to have them on conventional nonrebreather oxygen masks in the hospital (where they can get an emergency intubation if their condition worsens.) The improved mortality stats for high-flow nasal cannula are probably swamped by the increased risk associated with being at home and not being able to get an emergency intubation quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, building open-source CPAP, BIPAP, or high-flow nasal cannulas is not valuable for COVID-19, in any world where ICUs and ventilators are still available.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the situation deteriorates so badly that most people can’t go to ICUs at all, non-invasive home ventilation may be better than nothing, but it’s not the top priority for increasing capacity to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Existing Ventilator Design Projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen a lot of links to projects to design open-source ventilators to handle the current ventilator shortage. Many of these are automated bag masks, or CPAPs, which aren’t recommended for use in hospitals because they spread COVID-19; and they won’t work on the more severe cases of respiratory distress anyway.  Only two projects that I found, the Pandemic Ventilator and the Flometrics project, are explicitly trying to match the specifications of the type of mechanical ventilators found in ICUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.3dprintingmedia.network/covid-19-3d-printed-valve-for-reanimation-device/&quot;&gt;3D-Printed Venturi Valve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hospital in Italy, after being unable to source valves for Venturi oxygen masks, got emergency supplies from a local 3D printing company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is a worthwhile project, it is of course just a single part for an oxygen mask, not a ventilator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t2t8d8xtD0&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;Auto Bag Ventilator&lt;/a&gt; – a Rice University engineering student designed a low-cost, automatically pumping bag ventilator for low resource settings.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a type of ventilator for very short term use, in first aid emergencies. It is not a substitute for a mechanical ventilator because there is no way to calibrate the pressure exactly.  (A mechanical ventilator needs to be accurate to within at least 0.001 psi.)[6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also not safe for COVID-19 in hospital settings because of the risk of aerosolization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenSourceVentilators/comments/fgrsdg/pandemic_ventilator_project_requirements/&quot;&gt;Flometrics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a low cost mechanical ventilator based on a Shopvac, designed by one of the patent holders for the Phillips Espirit ventilator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of thing that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; designed to substitute for the mechanical ventilators used in ICUs, and could be very valuable if it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jcl5m1/ventilator&quot;&gt;Low-Cost Open Source Ventilator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a design for a modified CPAP machine for non-invasive ventilation.  
That means it’s not going to be usable in hospitals because of disease spread issues, and ~40% of the time, a person with COVID would need to escalate to intubation within a few days anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/2.75/projects/DMD_2010_Al_Husseini.pdf&quot;&gt;Low-Cost Portable Mechanical Ventilator&lt;/a&gt; – this is an MIT student project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This too is a bag ventilator equipped with a mechanical pump; therefore, not usable for COVID-19 in hospital settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metrictechnologies.com/&quot;&gt;Metric Technologies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They &lt;a href=&quot;https://helpwithcovid.com/projects/24&quot;&gt;claim&lt;/a&gt; to have a low-cost (&amp;lt;$300) ventilator design and are capable of training staff and deploying the devices. Unclear what type of device this is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onebreathventilators.com/&quot;&gt;OneBreath Ventilators&lt;/a&gt;
 
This Stanford-founded company is working to develop a low cost ICU ventilator for use in the developing world. These could be suitable for severe COVID-19 cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are not yet available for sale but they are open to outreach,  info@onebreathventilators.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/TrevorSmale/OSV-OpenLung&quot;&gt;OpenLung&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another motorized Ambu-bag. Again, these are not designed to be used for more than 10 hours at a time &amp;amp; won’t work for ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dz7eMgXowFBtBA_0PKzfAXweHnNMbGlIAXPshCbI2Vk/edit#&quot;&gt;Pandemic Ventilator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a project to build a mechanical ventilator for ARDS. They also have a blog at &lt;a href=&quot;https://panvent.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;https://panvent.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the type of thing that could potentially be valuable for severe cases of COVID-19; it’s meant to substitute for the type of mechanical ventilators that are currently in short supply. Any new, rapidly developed machine will not meet regulatory approval standards in the US, but in emergencies or in countries with less stringent laws, an unapproved (but functional) machine may be better than nothing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ventilator is designed to be deployed in hospitals, specifically in rural Latin America.  It is not for home care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;a.) increase production of ventilators by existing manufacturers

b.) work on open-source plans for building ventilators for hospitals

c.) regulatory efforts to approve hospitals to use emergency ventilators
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Shortages of Oxygen &amp;amp; Breathing Equipment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oxygen Concentrators&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oxygen concentrators were in short supply even before the pandemic – a June 2019 article notes that half of people who use portable oxygen supplies had problems with broken equipment or inadequate supplies of oxygen.[7]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ventilators&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a pandemic crisis, New York State is predicted to be short 15,783 mechanical ventilators a week at the peak of the outbreak.[8]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence that Non-Invasive Ventilation Spreads COVID-19&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ICU in Hong Kong gave guidance against bag mask ventilators:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend avoiding bag mask ventilation for as long as possible; and optimising preoxygenation with nonaerosol-generating means. Methods include the bed-up-head-elevated position, airway manoeuvres, use of a positive end expiratory pressure valve, and airway adjuncts. If manual bagging is required, we suggest gentle ventilation via a supraglottic device instead of bag mask ventilation.[9]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same guidelines were implemented by the largest acute care hospital in Singapore:
Infection prevention entails reducing aerosol-generating procedures (i.e., airway manipulation, face mask ventilation, open airway suctioning, patient coughing) as far as possible…Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation and high flow nasal cannulae such as the transnasal humidified rapid-insufflation ventilatory exchange should be avoided to reduce the risk of viral aerosolization…Venturi masks should be avoided as they may aerosolize the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;Improved symptoms in one case study of severe COVID-19&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remdesivir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An in-silico study of HIV drugs for their docking affinity to a key enzymes in the COVID-19 virus – RdRp, the main protein for RNA replication – found an almost perfect match in the antiviral drug remdesivir, suggesting it might be a good candidate drug for treating COVID-19.[3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remdesivir also inhibits the COVID-19 virus in vitro.[7]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remdesivir is effective at reducing the clinical signs of infection and viral load from MERS coronavirus in rhesus macaque monkeys; if given prophylactically, it prevents the monkeys from getting any disease symptoms at all and keeps their viral loads negligible.[10]  In mice, remdesivir is more effective than lopinavir/ritonavir in improving pulmonary function and reducing viral load from MERS infection.[11]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 3 US patients treated with remdesivir, 2 patients saw fever drop immediately upon receiving the drug (the third didn’t have a fever); one was able to go off supplemental oxygen; all recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remdesivir is currently in trials in China and the US for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chloroquine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief summary document [1] claims that clinical trials in China including over 100 patients have found the antimalarial drug chloroquine phosphate “superior to control treatment” in treating COVID-19 pneumonia and shortening disease course. The paper provided no documentation about experimental methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chloroquine also inhibits the replication of the COVID-19 virus in vitro,[7] as well as the SARS coronavirus in vitro.[9]  It does not inhibit the MERS coronavirus in vitro in a culture of monocyte-derived cells.[13]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chloroquine frequently causes gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhea, nausea), problems with visual acuity, insomnia, and paresthesias (prickling skin sensations.)[15]  More rarely, chloroquine can cause psychiatric symptoms like depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cinanserin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cinanserin is a serotonin receptor antagonist which was also found to inhibit the replication of the SARS virus in vitro. Cinanserin inhibits the activity of COVID-19’s main protease in vitro, and inhibits the virus’s replication in vitro.[5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cinanserin also inhibits the replication of the SARS coronavirus in vitro.[14]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lopinavir/Ritonavir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lopinavir/Ritonavir is a combination of two antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one Korean patient, aged 54, with mild pneumonia and a diagnosis of COVID-19, treatment with the antiviral drug combination of lopinavir and ritonavir diminished coronavirus load to undetectable levels.[2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lopinavir/Ritonavir was also used by the Thai infectious disease team to successfully treat patients with severe COVID-19.[3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lopinavir also had a high binding affinity to the COVID-19 protein 3CL-PRO in an in-silico screen of 3118 FDA-approved drugs.[4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lopinavir is a protease inhibitor, effective in vitro against the main protease of the SARS coronavirus; it also has in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV. Lopinavir reduced viral load and clinical symptoms of the MERS coronavirus in mice and marmoset monkeys.[6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In human SARS cases, treatment with lopinavir was associated with lower death rate (2.3%) and intubation rate (0%) compared with standard treatment (11% and 15.6% respectively.). Another case-control study of SARS found a lower rate of ARDS in patients treated with lopinavir (2.4% vs 28.8%).  [6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A retrospective study of 40 patients found that post-exposure prophylaxis including lopinavir/ritonavir reduced the spread of MERS-CoV by 40% in healthcare workers.  However, a retrospective study of 134 COVID-19 patients found no significant difference between lopinavir/ritonavir treatment, Abidol treatment, and control treatment.[6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indinavir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indinavir is an antiviral drug used to treat HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an in-silico screen of the binding affinity of 3118 FDA-approved drugs to several key enzymes of the COVID-19 virus, the highest-affinity drug for the protease PDB-6LU7 was indinavir, an antiviral drug approved for use against HIV.  (Even higher affinity were human proteins that closely resemble the enzyme’s ligand – ACE2 and GHRP-2.)  Indinavir also had a high binding affinity to another COVID-19 protein, 3CL-PRO.[4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in an in-vitro test against the SARS coronavirus, indinavir did not block replication.[12]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thalidomide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug used to treat cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 45-year-old woman with a severe case COVID-19, with fever, pneumonia, dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting, improved and went into remission after being treated with thalidomide, which has anti-inflammatory effects, reducing the “cytokine storm” responsible for the severe symptoms of COVID-19.[7]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-true-case-fatality-rate-for-young-people&quot;&gt;What Is The True Case Fatality Rate For Young People?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese data says 0.2% for ages 0-39 but this may be misleading for a several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a.) only includes data up to Feb. 11&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b.) may be biased upwards, because the overall case fatality rate was higher in the early days of the Wuhan outbreak while hospitals were overwhelmed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c.) may be biased upwards, because cases that had only mild symptoms might never have been reported or tested&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d.) may be biased downwards, not counting the higher death rates from people who never got access to a hospital and so never got diagnosed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data&quot;&gt;Johns Hopkins data&lt;/a&gt;, which is current up to March 4th, the overall/cumulative case fatality rate in China is 3.4%, and the case fatality rate outside China is 1.8%.  This lower number may be more predictive of the current case fatality rate since the case fatality rate inside China has dropped over time, from 17% (in January) to under 2% by Feb. 20th, as more individuals have been tested and hospital resources have been mobilized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall case recovery rate from the Johns Hopkins data is 54% worldwide but only 8% outside China. This may simply indicate recency; according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf&quot;&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;, mild cases take 2 weeks to recover and severe cases take 3-6 weeks. Or it may indicate that countries outside China are not following up with confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2762130&quot;&gt;Chinese data&lt;/a&gt; on 72,314 cases of COVID-19 (which gives ages for cases, unlike the global data) only about 10% of cases were in people younger than 30, and only 1% of the deaths among confirmed cases were in people younger than 30.  27% of the cases were in people younger than 40, and 2.5% of the deaths. While reporting of cases of coronavirus can be expected to be biased to more severe cases, there is no systematic reason why cases of similar severity would be more or less likely to be reported based on age, so the 10% case risk seems like a credible estimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sample of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(20)30026-1/fulltext&quot;&gt;509 cases&lt;/a&gt; whose demographic information was reported in the media, including cases from outside China, found that 12% of cases were younger than 30, which is similar to the Chinese figure; the sample included no deaths in patients younger than 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea may be our best possible estimate of the true case fatality rate, since it is a developed country with a very extensive testing program of more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-04/south-korea-tests-hundreds-of-thousands-to-fight-virus-outbreak&quot;&gt;140,000 people&lt;/a&gt; to date. It has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-new-cases-soar-south-korea-slow-in-china-2020-3&quot;&gt;6088 cases and 37 deaths&lt;/a&gt;, or a 0.6% case fatality rate.  In Korea, 35.2% of all cases were in people under 30, and 46.2% under age 40, but there have been no fatalities for people under 30.  There was 1 death of a person age 30-39, out of 693 cases in that age range.  This suggests that in a country with extensive testing for COVID-19, young people are more likely to contract the disease than the Chinese numbers would suggest, but no more likely to die of it. In fact, Korean case fatality rates across all age groups are lower than the corresponding Chinese case fatality rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-outbreak-death-toll-us-infections-latest-news-updates-2020-03-04/&quot;&gt;“At least 11 people have died of the COVID-19 disease in the U.S., all but one of them in Washington state, and most of them from a single nursing home in the Seattle area. The other death occurred in California, just outside Sacramento. The coronavirus has been confirmed in 17 states so far.”&lt;/a&gt;, according to a news article on March 5.  Since the number of US cases to date is currently 211, this gives a whopping 5% case fatality rate, but this number is likely inaccurate since the US is barely testing at all for COVID-19.  We don’t have enough data on US cases to get a believable US-specific case fatality rate by age group, but the pattern of deaths is consistent with the story that the disease is much more deadly for the elderly than for younger people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion: the true case fatality rate for Americans under age 40 is likely to be LOWER than the Chinese estimate of 0.2%.  The proportion of COVID-19 cases under age 40 is likely to be HIGHER than the Chinese estimate of 27%, perhaps as high as the Korean estimate of 46%.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chronic-non-fatal-sequelae-of-covid-19&quot;&gt;Chronic Non-Fatal Sequelae of COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 may be relatively common: 78 out of 214 patients in one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/25/2020.02.22.20026500.full.pdf]&quot;&gt;hospital study&lt;/a&gt;, or 36%, had neurological symptoms, most commonly muscle injury and loss of consciousness, but also a few cases of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00415-020-09773-9&quot;&gt;case study&lt;/a&gt; of a 62-year-old man in Wuhan who presented with oculomotor nerve palsy and whose throat swab tested positive for 2019-nCOV.  Other possible causes of the nerve palsy, such as stroke, diabetic neuropathy, brain tumor, and Guillain-Barre syndrome were ruled out, so his doctors hypothesized that the virus caused the nerve failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-03/05/c_138846529.htm&quot;&gt;case&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19, in Beijing, was confirmed to contain the virus in cerebrospinal fluid, in the first case of viral encephalitis due to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that COVID-19 can infiltrate the central nervous system, and evidence that neurological symptoms are common during COVID-19 infection, but it’s not as yet clear whether the neurological symptoms are usually caused by the virus infiltrating nerve and muscle tissue or whether they’re caused by other organ damage, by the treatments for COVID-19, or by the body’s inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SARS, an earlier coronavirus epidemic, did frequently cause chronic sequelae.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of 233 formerly hospitalized SARS survivors in one &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/415378&quot;&gt;follow-up study&lt;/a&gt;, 27.1% met the criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome, 40% had a psychiatric disorder, and 40% mentioned a chronic fatigue problem. Only 3%, by contrast, had a psychiatric disorder before contracting SARS; this indicates that SARS may have caused psychiatric problems. (Relatedly, the most common psychiatric disorder was post-traumatic stress disorder.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Johnny_Chan9/publication/228620287_Severe_Acute_Respiratory_Syndrome_SARS_A_Brief_Review_With_Exploration_of_the_Outcomes_Prognostic_Factors_and_Sequelae/links/541157e90cf2f2b29a412dc0.pdf&quot;&gt;Half of SARS survivors&lt;/a&gt;  who were hospitalized experienced mild reduction in pulmonary function even 3 months after being discharged from the hospital.  30-45% of survivors had bone necrosis in their hips or knees; this may be a consequence of the long-term use of corticosteroids in treating SARS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SARS has been found in one &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/49/12/2108/5642159&quot;&gt;case&lt;/a&gt; to infiltrate the cerebrospinal fluid, causing seizures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neurological symptoms are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ant-tnsjournal.com/Mag_Files/14-3/14-3_p113.pdf&quot;&gt;uncommon but possible&lt;/a&gt; in SARS; out of 664 SARS patients in Taiwan, eight (1%) were found to have neurological disorders: neuropathy, myopathy, and rhabdomyolysis.  5 out of 206 SARS patients in Singapore, or 2%, had strokes, while none had risk factors for strokes; this may be because SARS, like some other viral infections, causes a hypercoagulable state. These neuromuscular symptoms look similar to the ones observed in COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s reasonable to suppose that COVID-19, like SARS, can increase the risk of stroke and cause chronic nerve disorders in perhaps a few percent of patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though we don’t yet know whether COVID-19 causes chronic fatigue, there is a plausible mechanism: virus-induced immune dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 patients have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/20/2020.02.18.20024364.full.pdf&quot;&gt;diminished T-cell levels&lt;/a&gt;, and more severe cases have a larger reduction.  75% of 522 COVID-19 patients from a Chinese hospital had low T-cell levels, with the lowest levels found in the oldest patients. Inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha) was negatively correlated with T-cell count and positively correlated with the severity of the disease. This is consistent with the “cytokine storm” phenomenon, in which a spike in inflammatory cytokines is responsible for the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) which occur in severe and deadly cases of respiratory infections, including COVID-19, SARS, and H5N1.  This opens the door to a mechanism by which COVID-19 could cause long-term immune system dysregulation, if T-cell levels don’t go back to normal after a patient recovers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In conclusion, it seems at least somewhat likely that a high percentage of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, like SARS patients, may develop a chronic fatigue syndrome, and that a low percentage may develop chronic nerve damage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, let’s look at South Korea, as a baseline for a country with an outbreak of COVID-19 and extensive testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Korean officials said that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/09/asia/south-korea-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html&quot;&gt;only about 10%&lt;/a&gt; of coronavirus patients had cases severe enough to need hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In China, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2762130&quot;&gt;19% of confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; were “severe” or “critical”, but this number is likely higher than the true figure, due to limited access to test kits and mild cases of COVID-19 going unreported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20028423v1.full.pdf&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 391 patients in Shenzhen, China, 0 cases of COVID-19 among those &amp;lt;30 years old were “severe” (in need of mechanical ventilation, in a state of septic shock or multiple organ failure, or other serious criteria) and only 1% of those aged 30-39 were severe; overall, there was an 0.6% rate of severe cases among cases younger than age 40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rate of contracting COVID-19 among close contacts of confirmed cases, however, was relatively constant across age groups – 7-8%, including among children ages 0-9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(20)30101-8/fulltext&quot;&gt;262 patients in Beijing&lt;/a&gt;, however, 8% of cases younger than age 44 were “severe”, compared to 41% of cases older than age 65 and 17% of cases age 45-64.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study of 221 confirmed COVID-19 cases in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.20030452v1.full.pdf&quot;&gt;Wuhan&lt;/a&gt;, 8% of patients age 44 and under were classified as “severe”,  compared to 29% of cases aged 45-64 and 39% of cases over age 65.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all three Chinese cities, this comes to a rate of 4.9% of cases in under-40 or under-45 patients being severe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is probably an overestimate, since Chinese testing probably understates the number of mild cases – note that the Chinese numbers show 19% of cases being severe, while Korea, where everyone gets tested, only has 10% of cases severe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10% of all Korean cases are severe; let’s assume this is the true severity rate, since all Korean people were tested for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume that in China there is a bias against diagnosing mild cases; let’s assume there are m times more mild cases in reality than were picked up by the Chinese diagnostic testing, such that if you picked up &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the mild cases you’d actually get the Korean estimate of 10% of cases being severe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;136/(136 + m* (874-136)) = 0.10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;136 = 0.10&lt;em&gt;(136+ m&lt;/em&gt;738)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;73.8m = 122.4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;m = 1.66&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so let’s compute a &lt;em&gt;corrected&lt;/em&gt; estimate for the young person’s risk, assuming that there are 1.66x as many mild cases in young people than were observed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were 17 severe cases observed under 44, and 332 mild cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; number of mild cases in the three Chinese cities should actually be 332 * 1.66 = 551.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; corrected risk for getting severe disease as a young person is 17/551 = 3.1%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bottom-lines&quot;&gt;Bottom Lines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Young people exposed to COVID-19 are as likely as old people to become infected and contagious. Avoiding infection is prosocial, as it prevents passing COVID-19 to more vulnerable people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Young (&amp;lt;40) people who contract COVID-19 have a very low death rate, 0.1-0.2%.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Young (&amp;lt;40) people who contract the virus have a low (~3%) chance of having a “severe” case, requiring mechanical ventilation or other intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if hospital beds are unavailable, people with severe cases who don’t go to the hospital will likely die.  So this 3% severe case rate translates to more like a 3% fatality rate if a young person catches the disease when hospitals are over capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whether severe or mild, a high proportion of confirmed cases of SARS had chronic psychiatric and fatigue symptoms after recovery from acute illness, and it’s possible that similar problems may arise from COVID-19.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 can infect the cerebrospinal fluid, and a few percent of severe SARS cases had chronic neurological problems, so perhaps a similar number of severe COVID-19 cases might have chronic neurological sequelae.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="lit-review" /><category term="covid-19" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
