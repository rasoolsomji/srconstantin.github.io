      &lt;td&gt;Thalidomide&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Improved symptoms in one case study of severe COVID-19&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remdesivir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An in-silico study of HIV drugs for their docking affinity to a key enzymes in the COVID-19 virus – RdRp, the main protein for RNA replication – found an almost perfect match in the antiviral drug remdesivir, suggesting it might be a good candidate drug for treating COVID-19.[3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remdesivir also inhibits the COVID-19 virus in vitro.[7]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remdesivir is effective at reducing the clinical signs of infection and viral load from MERS coronavirus in rhesus macaque monkeys; if given prophylactically, it prevents the monkeys from getting any disease symptoms at all and keeps their viral loads negligible.[10]  In mice, remdesivir is more effective than lopinavir/ritonavir in improving pulmonary function and reducing viral load from MERS infection.[11]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 3 US patients treated with remdesivir, 2 patients saw fever drop immediately upon receiving the drug (the third didn’t have a fever); one was able to go off supplemental oxygen; all recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remdesivir is currently in trials in China and the US for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chloroquine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief summary document [1] claims that clinical trials in China including over 100 patients have found the antimalarial drug chloroquine phosphate “superior to control treatment” in treating COVID-19 pneumonia and shortening disease course. The paper provided no documentation about experimental methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chloroquine also inhibits the replication of the COVID-19 virus in vitro,[7] as well as the SARS coronavirus in vitro.[9]  It does not inhibit the MERS coronavirus in vitro in a culture of monocyte-derived cells.[13]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chloroquine frequently causes gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhea, nausea), problems with visual acuity, insomnia, and paresthesias (prickling skin sensations.)[15]  More rarely, chloroquine can cause psychiatric symptoms like depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cinanserin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cinanserin is a serotonin receptor antagonist which was also found to inhibit the replication of the SARS virus in vitro. Cinanserin inhibits the activity of COVID-19’s main protease in vitro, and inhibits the virus’s replication in vitro.[5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cinanserin also inhibits the replication of the SARS coronavirus in vitro.[14]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lopinavir/Ritonavir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lopinavir/Ritonavir is a combination of two antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one Korean patient, aged 54, with mild pneumonia and a diagnosis of COVID-19, treatment with the antiviral drug combination of lopinavir and ritonavir diminished coronavirus load to undetectable levels.[2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lopinavir/Ritonavir was also used by the Thai infectious disease team to successfully treat patients with severe COVID-19.[3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lopinavir also had a high binding affinity to the COVID-19 protein 3CL-PRO in an in-silico screen of 3118 FDA-approved drugs.[4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lopinavir is a protease inhibitor, effective in vitro against the main protease of the SARS coronavirus; it also has in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV. Lopinavir reduced viral load and clinical symptoms of the MERS coronavirus in mice and marmoset monkeys.[6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In human SARS cases, treatment with lopinavir was associated with lower death rate (2.3%) and intubation rate (0%) compared with standard treatment (11% and 15.6% respectively.). Another case-control study of SARS found a lower rate of ARDS in patients treated with lopinavir (2.4% vs 28.8%).  [6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A retrospective study of 40 patients found that post-exposure prophylaxis including lopinavir/ritonavir reduced the spread of MERS-CoV by 40% in healthcare workers.  However, a retrospective study of 134 COVID-19 patients found no significant difference between lopinavir/ritonavir treatment, Abidol treatment, and control treatment.[6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indinavir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indinavir is an antiviral drug used to treat HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an in-silico screen of the binding affinity of 3118 FDA-approved drugs to several key enzymes of the COVID-19 virus, the highest-affinity drug for the protease PDB-6LU7 was indinavir, an antiviral drug approved for use against HIV.  (Even higher affinity were human proteins that closely resemble the enzyme’s ligand – ACE2 and GHRP-2.)  Indinavir also had a high binding affinity to another COVID-19 protein, 3CL-PRO.[4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in an in-vitro test against the SARS coronavirus, indinavir did not block replication.[12]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thalidomide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug used to treat cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 45-year-old woman with a severe case COVID-19, with fever, pneumonia, dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting, improved and went into remission after being treated with thalidomide, which has anti-inflammatory effects, reducing the “cytokine storm” responsible for the severe symptoms of COVID-19.[7]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-true-case-fatality-rate-for-young-people&quot;&gt;What Is The True Case Fatality Rate For Young People?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese data says 0.2% for ages 0-39 but this may be misleading for a several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a.) only includes data up to Feb. 11
b.) may be biased upwards, because the overall case fatality rate was higher in the early days of the Wuhan outbreak while hospitals were overwhelmed
c.) may be biased upwards, because cases that had only mild symptoms might never have been reported or tested
d.) may be biased downwards, not counting the higher death rates from people who never got access to a hospital and so never got diagnosed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data&quot;&gt;Johns Hopkins data&lt;/a&gt;, which is current up to March 4th, the overall/cumulative case fatality rate in China is 3.4%, and the case fatality rate outside China is 1.8%.  This lower number may be more predictive of the current case fatality rate since the case fatality rate inside China has dropped over time, from 17% (in January) to under 2% by Feb. 20th, as more individuals have been tested and hospital resources have been mobilized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall case recovery rate from the Johns Hopkins data is 54% worldwide but only 8% outside China. This may simply indicate recency; according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf&quot;&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;, mild cases take 2 weeks to recover and severe cases take 3-6 weeks. Or it may indicate that countries outside China are not following up with confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2762130&quot;&gt;Chinese data&lt;/a&gt; on 72,314 cases of COVID-19 (which gives ages for cases, unlike the global data) only about 10% of cases were in people younger than 30, and only 1% of the deaths among confirmed cases were in people younger than 30.  27% of the cases were in people younger than 40, and 2.5% of the deaths. While reporting of cases of coronavirus can be expected to be biased to more severe cases, there is no systematic reason why cases of similar severity would be more or less likely to be reported based on age, so the 10% case risk seems like a credible estimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sample of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(20)30026-1/fulltext&quot;&gt;509 cases&lt;/a&gt; whose demographic information was reported in the media, including cases from outside China, found that 12% of cases were younger than 30, which is similar to the Chinese figure; the sample included no deaths in patients younger than 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea may be our best possible estimate of the true case fatality rate, since it is a developed country with a very extensive testing program of more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-04/south-korea-tests-hundreds-of-thousands-to-fight-virus-outbreak&quot;&gt;140,000 people&lt;/a&gt; to date. It has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-new-cases-soar-south-korea-slow-in-china-2020-3&quot;&gt;6088 cases and 37 deaths&lt;/a&gt;, or a 0.6% case fatality rate.  In Korea, 35.2% of all cases were in people under 30, and 46.2% under age 40, but there have been no fatalities for people under 30.  There was 1 death of a person age 30-39, out of 693 cases in that age range.  This suggests that in a country with extensive testing for COVID-19, young people are more likely to contract the disease than the Chinese numbers would suggest, but no more likely to die of it. In fact, Korean case fatality rates across all age groups are lower than the corresponding Chinese case fatality rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-outbreak-death-toll-us-infections-latest-news-updates-2020-03-04/&quot;&gt;“At least 11 people have died of the COVID-19 disease in the U.S., all but one of them in Washington state, and most of them from a single nursing home in the Seattle area. The other death occurred in California, just outside Sacramento. The coronavirus has been confirmed in 17 states so far.”&lt;/a&gt;, according to a news article on March 5.  Since the number of US cases to date is currently 211, this gives a whopping 5% case fatality rate, but this number is likely inaccurate since the US is barely testing at all for COVID-19.  We don’t have enough data on US cases to get a believable US-specific case fatality rate by age group, but the pattern of deaths is consistent with the story that the disease is much more deadly for the elderly than for younger people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion: the true case fatality rate for Americans under age 40 is likely to be LOWER than the Chinese estimate of 0.2%.  The proportion of COVID-19 cases under age 40 is likely to be HIGHER than the Chinese estimate of 27%, perhaps as high as the Korean estimate of 46%.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chronic-non-fatal-sequelae-of-covid-19&quot;&gt;Chronic Non-Fatal Sequelae of COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 may be relatively common: 78 out of 214 patients in one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/25/2020.02.22.20026500.full.pdf]&quot;&gt;hospital study&lt;/a&gt;, or 36%, had neurological symptoms, most commonly muscle injury and loss of consciousness, but also a few cases of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00415-020-09773-9&quot;&gt;case study&lt;/a&gt; of a 62-year-old man in Wuhan who presented with oculomotor nerve palsy and whose throat swab tested positive for 2019-nCOV.  Other possible causes of the nerve palsy, such as stroke, diabetic neuropathy, brain tumor, and Guillain-Barre syndrome were ruled out, so his doctors hypothesized that the virus caused the nerve failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-03/05/c_138846529.htm&quot;&gt;case&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19, in Beijing, was confirmed to contain the virus in cerebrospinal fluid, in the first case of viral encephalitis due to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that COVID-19 can infiltrate the central nervous system, and evidence that neurological symptoms are common during COVID-19 infection, but it’s not as yet clear whether the neurological symptoms are usually caused by the virus infiltrating nerve and muscle tissue or whether they’re caused by other organ damage, by the treatments for COVID-19, or by the body’s inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SARS, an earlier coronavirus epidemic, did frequently cause chronic sequelae.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of 233 formerly hospitalized SARS survivors in one &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/415378&quot;&gt;follow-up study&lt;/a&gt;, 27.1% met the criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome, 40% had a psychiatric disorder, and 40% mentioned a chronic fatigue problem. Only 3%, by contrast, had a psychiatric disorder before contracting SARS; this indicates that SARS may have caused psychiatric problems. (Relatedly, the most common psychiatric disorder was post-traumatic stress disorder.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Johnny_Chan9/publication/228620287_Severe_Acute_Respiratory_Syndrome_SARS_A_Brief_Review_With_Exploration_of_the_Outcomes_Prognostic_Factors_and_Sequelae/links/541157e90cf2f2b29a412dc0.pdf&quot;&gt;Half of SARS survivors&lt;/a&gt;  who were hospitalized experienced mild reduction in pulmonary function even 3 months after being discharged from the hospital.  30-45% of survivors had bone necrosis in their hips or knees; this may be a consequence of the long-term use of corticosteroids in treating SARS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SARS has been found in one &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/49/12/2108/5642159&quot;&gt;case&lt;/a&gt; to infiltrate the cerebrospinal fluid, causing seizures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neurological symptoms are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ant-tnsjournal.com/Mag_Files/14-3/14-3_p113.pdf&quot;&gt;uncommon but possible&lt;/a&gt; in SARS; out of 664 SARS patients in Taiwan, eight (1%) were found to have neurological disorders: neuropathy, myopathy, and rhabdomyolysis.  5 out of 206 SARS patients in Singapore, or 2%, had strokes, while none had risk factors for strokes; this may be because SARS, like some other viral infections, causes a hypercoagulable state. These neuromuscular symptoms look similar to the ones observed in COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s reasonable to suppose that COVID-19, like SARS, can increase the risk of stroke and cause chronic nerve disorders in perhaps a few percent of patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though we don’t yet know whether COVID-19 causes chronic fatigue, there is a plausible mechanism: virus-induced immune dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 patients have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/20/2020.02.18.20024364.full.pdf&quot;&gt;diminished T-cell levels&lt;/a&gt;, and more severe cases have a larger reduction.  75% of 522 COVID-19 patients from a Chinese hospital had low T-cell levels, with the lowest levels found in the oldest patients. Inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha) was negatively correlated with T-cell count and positively correlated with the severity of the disease. This is consistent with the “cytokine storm” phenomenon, in which a spike in inflammatory cytokines is responsible for the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) which occur in severe and deadly cases of respiratory infections, including COVID-19, SARS, and H5N1.  This opens the door to a mechanism by which COVID-19 could cause long-term immune system dysregulation, if T-cell levels don’t go back to normal after a patient recovers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In conclusion, it seems at least somewhat likely that a high percentage of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, like SARS patients, may develop a chronic fatigue syndrome, and that a low percentage may develop chronic nerve damage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-likely-are-young-people-to-have-severehospital-worthy-cases-of-covid-19&quot;&gt;How Likely Are Young People To Have Severe/Hospital-Worthy Cases of COVID-19?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, let’s look at South Korea, as a baseline for a country with an outbreak of COVID-19 and extensive testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Korean officials said that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/09/asia/south-korea-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html&quot;&gt;only about 10%&lt;/a&gt; of coronavirus patients had cases severe enough to need hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In China, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2762130&quot;&gt;19% of confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; were “severe” or “critical”, but this number is likely higher than the true figure, due to limited access to test kits and mild cases of COVID-19 going unreported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20028423v1.full.pdf&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 391 patients in Shenzhen, China, 0 cases of COVID-19 among those &amp;lt;30 years old were “severe” (in need of mechanical ventilation, in a state of septic shock or multiple organ failure, or other serious criteria) and only 1% of those aged 30-39 were severe; overall, there was an 0.6% rate of severe cases among cases younger than age 40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rate of contracting COVID-19 among close contacts of confirmed cases, however, was relatively constant across age groups – 7-8%, including among children ages 0-9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(20)30101-8/fulltext&quot;&gt;262 patients in Beijing&lt;/a&gt;, however, 8% of cases younger than age 44 were “severe”, compared to 41% of cases older than age 65 and 17% of cases age 45-64.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study of 221 confirmed COVID-19 cases in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.20030452v1.full.pdf&quot;&gt;Wuhan&lt;/a&gt;, 8% of patients age 44 and under were classified as “severe”,  compared to 29% of cases aged 45-64 and 39% of cases over age 65.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all three Chinese cities, this comes to a rate of 3% of cases in under-40 or under-45 patients being severe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we assume the age distribution of severity is the same in Korea vs. China, but that the Korean rate of severe illness is the correct one, this gives us 3/19*10 = 1.6% probability of a person under 40 having a severe case, given that they have been infected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bottom-lines&quot;&gt;Bottom Lines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Young people exposed to COVID-19 are as likely as old people to become infected and contagious. Avoiding infection is prosocial, as it prevents passing COVID-19 to more vulnerable people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Young (&amp;lt;40) people who contract COVID-19 have a very low death rate, 0.1-0.2%.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Young (&amp;lt;40) people who contract the virus have a low (~1.6%) chance of having a “severe” case, requiring mechanical ventilation or other intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if hospital beds are unavailable, people with severe cases who don’t go to the hospital will likely die.  So this 1-2% severe case rate translates to more like a 1-2% fatality rate if a young person catches the disease when hospitals are over capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whether severe or mild, a high proportion of confirmed cases of SARS had chronic psychiatric and fatigue symptoms after recovery from acute illness, and it’s possible that similar problems may arise from COVID-19.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 can infect the cerebrospinal fluid, and a few percent of severe SARS cases had chronic neurological problems, so perhaps a similar number of severe COVID-19 cases might have chronic neurological sequelae.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="lit-review" /><category term="covid-19" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Intro Post</title><link href="/2020/03/13/intro-post.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Intro Post" /><published>2020-03-13T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-03-13T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>/2020/03/13/intro-post</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2020/03/13/intro-post.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rembrandtfaust.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;faust&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been blogging in various places for nearly a decade, but I’ve never actually hosted my own site, or consolidated all my writing in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now it’s past time for me to start taking my writing/blogging more seriously.&lt;br /&gt;
I want it to be searchable and all in one place, and I want to own my own data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Github now makes hosting easy, and supports the blogging framework Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always find it nice when people are transparent about their process, so I’ll share  mine: it’s taken me about 3-4 days to get Jekyll working and my posts migrated from all my old blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this site I’ll be aggregating my old posts from &lt;a href=&quot;https://srconstantin.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Otium&lt;/a&gt;, my &lt;a href=&quot;https://srconstantin.posthaven.com&quot;&gt;Posthaven site&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://parentingwithevidence.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Parenting with Evidence&lt;/a&gt;, and the now defunct Hourglass Bio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll cross-promote posts on &lt;a href=&quot;//https://twitter.com/s_r_constantin&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (where my handle is @s_r_constantin) and, of course, you can subscribe using RSS.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog-meta" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Tangled Thinking 2 – Motivated Cognition and Its Opposite</title><link href="/2020/02/24/tangled-thinking-2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tangled Thinking 2 -- Motivated Cognition and Its Opposite" /><published>2020-02-24T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-02-24T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>/2020/02/24/tangled-thinking-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2020/02/24/tangled-thinking-2.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/escherlizards.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;lizards&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motivated cognition is the state of emotionally needing to believe something is true, whether it actually is true or not. 
I’ve found that a good kinaesthetic metaphor for motivated cognition is pressure.  If you’re forcing things with your mind – if you’re going “it’s GOT to be this way, or ELSE” – then you aren’t actually open to the truth being whatever it might happen to be.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defensiveness, anxiety, revulsion, despair, eagerness to please or to be acceptable, can motivate you to believe that the convenient and pleasant thing is true – or that the awful worst-case scenario is – or both at once (e.g. anxiety can make you fear the worst but flinch from it and profess the best-case scenario.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not motivated cognition for &lt;em&gt;motivation to be involved in cognition&lt;/em&gt;.  We think most clearly, in fact, when we’re motivated to do so; for instance, someone who stands to make money by making the correct prediction will be more motivated to be correct than someone who’s merely having a conversation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I think motivation is &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; to all the words we use to talk about thinking well  – rationality, wisdom, objectivity, science, empiricism, common sense, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tMhEv28KJYWsu6Wdo/kensh&quot;&gt;“Looking”&lt;/a&gt;, etc. These words get corrupted by connotations of smugness, coldness, superiority, or authoritarianism, and new words have to be continually invented to point at the same thing the old words were intended to point at.  The &lt;em&gt;thing itself&lt;/em&gt; is, perhaps, best described as “thinking in the way everyone naturally does when they actually care about the object of their thought.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you care about the thing in the real world, you will not want to be wrong about it; a delusion, however pleasant, won’t give you what you want.  You still can be wrong about it, of course, but your incentives are to be as correct as you can be.  A certain amount of pretense and posturing and game-playing may drop away suddenly when, for instance, you find your child’s safety is at stake; suddenly it is vitally important to get real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Of course, phrases like “get real”, “be sensible”, “be reasonable”, often are used to mean “shut up and do what I tell you”, which is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the thing. A person who Actually Cares about getting something done may often be perceived as an unreasonable or irrational person, because she is doing something that doesn’t meet with everyone’s approval.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s something related about words like “literally”, “truly”, “actually”, “really”, “very”, “honestly” – and it’s telling that over time language evolves to make them all used as words for emphasis instead of denoting literal exact truth.  It’s hard to find a way to phrase in words “I’m pointing at reality now” as opposed to pointing at a model of reality, or playing a game with language, or speaking ‘in character’ as the persona you want to embody right now.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notions like “rationality” are attempts to encourage people to think and speak literally rather than performatively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like sort of a mistake to present them as a specialized discipline to be taught rather than a stance to be adopted that most people naturally have by default from time to time. Doing science doesn’t actually involve going through The Scientific Method as you’re taught in elementary school; but while there may not really be a Scientific Method, there is definitely a scientific mindset. It’s the same mindset you have automatically when you’re curious. 
 
If you try to codify how people think when they’re being curious, it winds up sounding like nothing at all.  “Just, y’know, think! Look! Care! Try!”
Or it comes across as condescending: “Most people go through life never actually trying! You should actually try!” There’s not much content to this, but the “actually” is gesturing at something: the rubber meeting the road, the moon and not the pointing finger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, motivated cognition is being motivated to have certain cognitions, inside your head, rather than being motivated to seek outcomes out in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s kind of weird that we have this feature at all. Why would we have evolved to self-deceive? If an apparently self-destructive behavior is common, this cries out for explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we (often) care more about the insides of our heads than what’s going on outside them?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="tangled-thinking" /><category term="cog-psych" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Tangled Thinking 1 – Mental Objects, Contradictions, Reconciliation</title><link href="/2020/02/21/tangled-thinking-1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tangled Thinking 1 -- Mental Objects, Contradictions, Reconciliation" /><published>2020-02-21T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-02-21T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>/2020/02/21/tangled-thinking-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2020/02/21/tangled-thinking-1.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ascending-and-descending-escher.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ascending&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Mental Objects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s call a &lt;strong&gt;mental object&lt;/strong&gt; anything that you’re aware of, anything that is in your conscious mind. A sense perception, a feeling, a thought, a concept, anything that is under the spotlight of your consciousness at a given moment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tautologically, if you have &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; access to something in the world, it must be a mental object; it must enter your perception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you even know there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an external world?  Why isn’t it “all in your mind”?  What’s even the difference between a totally imaginary world playing out in your consciousness, and a “real world” that’s “out there”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without being knowledgeable about the history of philosophy and the many people who have attempted to answer this question, I think there’s a pretty straightforward way to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difference Detection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things your mind can do is ask the question “same or different?” about two mental objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Same or different?” can apply on multiple meta-levels.  You can say “do these propositions contradict?”  You can say “do these motives conflict?”  You can say “does my observation match my prediction?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “evidence” for this proposition is just that you can try it out in your own mind and see if it works.  It’s also analytically necessary that this be true if we believe that people have goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any kind of optimizing behavior can be viewed as optimizing to minimize a distance or difference between the desired and actual situation. Which means you need to be able to detect differences. If we are goal-achieving machines, we must also be difference-detecting machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there are some computational models that fit psychophysics data quite well, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.15.2644&quot;&gt;Waltz Filtering&lt;/a&gt;, where you can view the process of visually parsing a line drawing, as an optimization problem where we try to minimize the number of inconsistencies in interpretations of the drawing as representing a 3-d object. (Unreconcilable inconsistencies lead to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_object&quot;&gt;impossible figures&lt;/a&gt;, where we “see” the figure as representing a 3-d form locally, but then can’t extend that same interpretation consistently to the whole figure.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychophysics data also tells us that our sensory perceptions are keyed to differences, not absolute magnitudes; far more people have relative pitch than absolute pitch, for instance, and our color perceptions are relative to background and lighting, not absolute.  Detecting “same or different?” seems to be more “primitive” or “fundamental” an operation in the brain than detecting “how much?”  In many cases, at least, it seems that we have “difference detectors” and construct absolute measurements out of those, rather than having “absolute magnitude detectors” and computing differences by subtracting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolving Contradictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A” and “Not A” is a flat contradiction – an impossibility.  The mind boggles. It cannot be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not all differences, of course, are impossibilities. It’s possible to notice that a dress has fabric in two different colors, and this doesn’t slow us down a bit.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens is a kind of “going meta”, I think.  You say “oh, no problem: it’s A here, and not-A there.”  Distinction by dividing up the mental world. “Hey, A and not-A, you can share.”  Now there is no contradiction and everything is hunky-dory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, you can explain away one half of the contradiction: “oh, I only believed not-A because I was misled by such-and-such; now I can safely discard it as a mistake.”  Again, no problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, you can reframe A and not-A so they are both parts of a whole, or not really opposites after all.  There are a lot of things you can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially what you’re doing is handling an &lt;a href=&quot;https://intelligence.org/files/OntologicalCrises.pdf&quot;&gt;ontological crisis&lt;/a&gt;.  You resolve an apparent contradiction by adding some complexity to your mental world, such that both apparently contradicting mental objects are compatible and explainable (or explain-away-able) by your new, expanded view of the world.  It’s the process of noticing that the blind men were seeing different parts of the elephant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a contradiction, but really, if you shake it all around, if you learn more, if you do some trial and error, you can get into a new configuration where the knot untangles and it all makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what “thinking” is, I believe. Messing around with your mental objects until apparent contradictions resolve.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this tells us what it means to believe in an external “world.”  It means that you believe that your space of mental objects will come to include things that it does not yet include, but which recontextualize today’s apparent contradictions so they make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIol4aENNEw&quot;&gt;“we will understand it better by and by.”&lt;/a&gt;  Everything has an explanation; everything came from the same world.  If we took a wide enough view, everything would make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a kind of faith, but a very minimal sort – the faith that you live in an intelligible universe, that ultimately you can make more and more sense of things.  Or the stance of trying to see things from the perspective of how they would look once you had made sense of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solving Problems Is What Brains Like Doing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lulie Tanett likes to write about how “reason is fun” and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reasonisfun.com/blog/problems-are-good/&quot;&gt;“problems are good”&lt;/a&gt; – that humans literally enjoy the process of problem-solving.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, most of our “play” is puzzle-solving – trying to achieve an objective despite an apparent obstacle, or trying to make sense of something initially confusing. Videogames are puzzles even when they’re not “puzzle games”. Sports are puzzles.  Even reading or watching a work of fiction, or listening to music, gets much of its “fun” from a dance between predictability and surprise (and ultimate resolution of the apparent mystery or discordance.) Many of the things we do for no reason other than enjoyment are problem-solving activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have an instinctive desire to tug on problems in attempts to solve them. That doesn’t mean all problems are perceived as unpleasant.  Sometimes the “problem-solving” happens faster than we can be aware of it; sometimes the process itself is pleasurable. Only sometimes do we have a negative feeling around the problem, and it’s not merely because the problem exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suffering = Problems Metastasizing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just having a problem – your conscious mind includes both “A” and “Not A” – doesn’t necessarily cause suffering. But if you then go “there IS a contradiction” and “but there CAN’T be a contradiction”, then things start to get worse. Or “I have mixed feelings” but “but I MUSTN’T have mixed feelings”, or “this is hard” and “but it SHOULDN’T be hard”, and so on. Somehow a problem can result in, not an attempt at resolution, but more problems!  More contradictory beliefs, which vibrate against each other, and make more and more friction in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is usually what’s going on when something really bothers us.  Have you ever noticed that sometimes a big life problem stops being upsetting, not when it goes away, but when you find something you can do about it?  You flip out of “bemoaning and denying that the issue is there at all”, focus instead on some constructive activity toward solving the issue, and suddenly it gets easier? Because now all you have to cope with is the issue itself, not the exhausting “is it real or isn’t it”, “should I admit it hurts or tough it out”, internal debates. You now have one less problem to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have problems about problems, issues about issues, etc, it gets much harder to deal with them. These are psychological truisms: negative emotions are worse if you’re ashamed of feeling them; abuse is harder to recover from if everyone around you insists it’s not real; dealing with misfortune is harder if you’re still in denial about it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a “meta-problem” means having an internal contradiction around the concept of the problem itself.  “This problem exists” and “this problem doesn’t exist” battle in your head. Trying to believe in a contradiction, trying to do the literally impossible, maintaining the conviction that you should be able to believe contradictions or do the impossible – all of these are ways of making meta-problems out of problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Buddhist concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%E1%B9%87h%C4%81&quot;&gt;tanha&lt;/a&gt; is usually translated as “craving” or “desire”, but it literally means “fuel” and is associated with clinging or persistence, trying to make mental states stick around.  If I were to try to map it to this model, I’d say that tanha is the mental motion of returning to a contradiction or a knot in the mind, and trying to will it to not be a knot, thereby creating a bigger meta-knot.  It’s what you do when you remind yourself of a frustration in a way that makes it more and more frustrating.  You keep the contradiction bouncing back and forth, louder and louder – it IS, but it SHOULDN’T BE, and moreover nothing should BE HOW IT SHOULDN’T, but some people told me I should ACCEPT THINGS AS THEY ARE, but I DON’T LIKE THAT…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That “outward spiral” makes it harder and harder to resolve the problem at the root of the whole thing, because every time you notice it, it activates all the other meta-problems.  I think this is the structural underpinning of what we experience as negative emotions, “touchy subjects”, and “sore spots.”  They’re wounds that defend themselves from healing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, if we believe in a world, we must believe that this process too comes from the world, that there is a reason why problems sometimes grow their own defenses. But it’s tricky and deserves exploration at length.  You’re looking at a process that doesn’t “want” to be looked at.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="tangled-thinking" /><category term="cog-psych" /><summary type="html">Mental Objects</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Aging Interventions From Old Papers</title><link href="/2020/01/15/aging-interventions-from-old-papers.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Aging Interventions From Old Papers" /><published>2020-01-15T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-01-15T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>/2020/01/15/aging-interventions-from-old-papers</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2020/01/15/aging-interventions-from-old-papers.html">&lt;hr /&gt;

title: Aging Interventions from Older Publications that Deserve a New Look
tags: [aging, lit-review]
—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Read Old Papers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, from what I’m told by knowledgeable people, there’s a fairly tight feedback loop between current aging research and the biotech industry. When a new, major aging-related paper comes out, there are people seriously evaluating whether they can start a company around it. 
But that isn’t necessarily true when it comes to old research. There’s no automatic means by which old papers “go viral.”  There are no conferences (that I know of) where people call their colleagues’ attention to remarkable, decades-old results that haven’t received follow-up investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think old papers deserve a second look, for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.) Often a result that had little interpretability or applicability in the past can benefit from contemporary tools. 
Let’s say, twenty years ago researchers found a way to extend life in rats – but it was a surgical operation that would be too invasive or risky to try on healthy humans. And maybe that was the end of that research direction.  But now we have lots of new options! We can take tissue samples with and without the intervention, and look at gene and protein expression, even down to the individual cell level. We can identify genetic modifications or drug targets that could be used to simulate the intervention in a safer, more targeted way.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.) Looking at old papers reduces some of the biases that come from looking at the latest, most-cited papers.
The volume of scientific publications is increasing at an exponential rate, up to 4% a year.[1] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/morepapers.png&quot; alt=&quot;morepapers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the reliability of the average publication has probably decreased. If there are indeed “diminishing returns to science” in recent decades, as Patrick Collison and Michael Nielsen argue [2], with roughly constant rates of important discoveries (as rated by experts) and flat economic productivity (a measure that we’d expect to correlate with technological progress) despite exponentially growing numbers of scientists, publications, and dollars devoted to science, then the quality of the average paper, scientist, or dollar allocated to research must have gone down. In that case, a randomly chosen older paper should be more trustworthy than a newer paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might counter that the new papers that get the most attention aren’t randomly chosen – they’re the highly cited papers, or the papers in prominent journals. Maybe the average paper has gotten worse, but the average is being pulled down by junk papers in journals so low-quality and obscure that barely anybody reads them; so, perhaps, the typical new paper that a colleague (or your twitter feed) brings to your attention is no less credible than a comparable old paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that optimistic outlook is doubtful; in fact, articles in prestigious (high-impact-factor) journals are more likely than average to be retracted, and many measures of research reliability anticorrelate with impact factor, implying that articles the most prestigious journals are less trustworthy than average[3]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;*	overestimating effect size in gene-association 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;studies increases with impact factor (more bias in more prestigious journals)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;*	sample size in gene-association studies decreases with impact factor

*	statistical power in psychology and cognitive science papers decreases with impact factor

*	randomization in animal studies is reported less frequently in papers from high-impact-factor journals

*	errors in supplemental data (eg Excel auto-converting a gene name to a date) are more common in papers from high-impact-factor journals

*	p-value reporting errors, usually in the direction of misinterpreting a non-significant result as significant, are more common in papers from high-impact-factor journals

*	metrics to identify tell-tale signs of questionable research practices find lower research quality in higher-impact-factor journals.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, no, we can’t assume that the most-cited papers of today are the cream of the crop. If anything, there’s more pressure today than ever to get dramatic but untrustworthy results, and that pressure is highest at the most competitive journals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to reverse this effect is to go back in time.  If the amount of noise in the system is increasing, an old paper is more likely to have a valid signal than a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.) Low technology can be a blessing in disguise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The miracle of modern molecular biology is that we keep developing better tools to affordably do breadth-first searches. “Sequence ALL the genes!” “Quantify ALL the transcripts!” “Quantify ALL the proteins!” And so on.
The danger of having these incredible tools is that you can cherrypick positive results – and people do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s much harder to erroneously get an apparently therapeutic intervention if your tools are blunter and your search space is smaller. If somebody in 1944 says that shining light on a duck’s head makes its testes grow[4], then by gum I bet that actually happens!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it’s not coming from a breadth-first search, somebody had to have a specific reason to think that the experiment would work, and because there just aren’t that many experiments being done at random, you can expect that to be a well-informed reason. The prior is higher.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a similar sense in which lack of standardization is a blessing in disguise. Most mammal experiments today are done on the same handful of strains of inbred mice, for instance. The standardization is a boon to researchers in many ways (you can make apples-to-apples comparisons, you don’t have to spend time inventing the basics of experimental methods yourself) but it also means that experimental results can just turn out to be an artifact of the “standard methodology.”  Looking at older experiments, which have greater diversity in model organisms and other experimental methods, can be a corrective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.) Old papers are undervalued opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author of the latest exciting result is a ready-made advocate for the discovery and a potential founder or collaborator for new ventures to put it into practice.  The author of an old paper, by contrast, might be dead or retired, with nobody to champion the potential applications of the discovery. It’s very easy for an area of research to quietly fall out of fashion through no inherent lack of merit, just because it never met the right opportunity for application. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just barely old enough to remember when neural nets were thought of as an embarrassing phase in the history of computer science; they became “hot” again in 2012, with AlexNet, when newly affordable GPUs proved that deep learning algorithms could suddenly outperform the competition. In other words, advances in a totally different technology made a “failed” research approach into an overnight success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going through old, not necessarily well-known experiments to see if there are opportunities is something I don’t believe is being done that often, and is probably an unusually good place to apply a little bit of time and attention for big returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, let’s look at some specific examples!  These are all results from prior to the year 2000, that are experimental interventions affecting vertebrate lifespan or aging, and which aren’t currently the focus of a research program that I’m aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lowering Body Temperature: 71% Life Extension in Fish&lt;/strong&gt; 
Unusually long-lived vertebrates (tortoises, sharks, rockfish, etc, which can survive for centuries, or naked mole rats, which are extremely long-lived for their size) are frequently cold-blooded.  Warm-blooded animals which are long-lived (in absolute terms, like whales, or relative to their size, like bats, hummingbirds, and squirrels) often undergo temporary reductions in body temperature, during diving or hibernation.  Moreover, interventions like dietary restriction which extend lifespan have the effect of reducing body temperature.  So can reducing body temperature directly extend life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a cold-blooded example, transferring fish from 20-degree water to 15-degree water extended lifespan by 71%, in a 1972 study.[5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reduce the body temperature of a warm-blooded animal, it’s not enough to reduce ambient temperature, since warm-blooded animals generate heat to compensate. In fact, reducing the ambient temperature actually shortens mouse lifespan. However, there are tricks to lower body temperature in a warm-blooded animal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mice genetically modified to overexpress the uncoupling protein, UCP2, in the hypothalamus have lower body temperature than wild-type[6], and they live longer than their wild-type counterparts (20% increase in female median lifespan, 12% in male.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also induce hypothermia by stimulating the heat-detecting cells in the hypothalamus, either by injecting capsaicin [7], heating the hypothalamus directly with a thermode [8], or stimulating the heat-sensing neurons optogenetically [9].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The natural next experiments to do are a.) see if any of these other methods of inducing hypothermia affect lifespan and diseases of aging in mice or other mammals; b.) do longitudinal transcriptomics or other broad assays to see what reduced body temperature is doing and whether its effects can be simulated chemically or genetically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Altered Photoperiod Cycle Length: Short “Years” Shorten Lifespan 30% in Lemurs&lt;/strong&gt; 
Days get longer in summer and shorter in winter; by lengthening or shortening the cycle of alteration in photoperiod length (by changing artificial lighting) you can give an animal a shorter or longer subjective “year”. 
This turns out to affect lifespan!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gray mouse lemur is a prosimian primate, native to Madagascar, that is long-lived for its size. During the long-day summer, gray mouse lemurs breed and are more active; during the short-day winter, they gain weight, become lethargic, and don’t copulate. If you alter the photoperiod cycle artificially, you can alter the timing of these behavioral and morphological changes accordingly – and if you reduce the “year length” by a third, from 12 months to 8 months, lifespan also shortens by 30% and the onset of white fur happens 30% earlier. [10] . In other words, lemurs live 9-10 “subjective years”, whether those are 8-month years or 12-month years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious follow-up experiment is to go the other direction – do lemurs (or other animals) live longer if you subject them to 16-month subjective years? And to take some tissue and blood samples and try to identify how this effect works – do we see pathological changes, transcriptional changes, hormonal changes, metabolic changes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constant Light Exposure: 25% Life Extension in Hamsters&lt;/strong&gt; 
A Syrian hamster model of congenital heart disease showed delayed onset of heart failure and 25% life extension if they were kept in continuously lit conditions.[11] 
The obvious corollary studies are to take heart tissue samples and blood samples and look for altered gene expression or metabolic parameters that might explain the effect of light exposure on preventing heart failure. It also might be possible to experiment directly with continuous light exposure on humans, since it’s probably not dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pineal-Thymus Graft: 24% Life Extension in Aged Mice&lt;/strong&gt; 
Implanting the pineal gland of a young mouse into the thymus of an old (16-22 month) mouse extends lifespan 19% in C57BL6 mice, 20% in Balb/c mice, and 35% in hybrid mice, for an average of 24% overall.[12] This is consonant with a more extensive literature about the pineal gland or the main hormone (melatonin) it secretes having a life-extending effect through preventing the dysregulation of the circadian rhythm which occurs with age. 
The obvious follow-up study to do is a replication of the same implantation experiment, along with longitudinal expression data, to find out how this works and work towards identifying how a similar effect could be replicated by a less invasive intervention.
Splenectomy: 19% Life Extension in Aged Mice 
In a 1969 experiment, adding spleen cells to mice of the same age as the cell donors shortened lifespan; adding spleen cells from younger mice (14 week) to older mice (76 week) extended median lifespan from 105 weeks to 128 weeks, a 13% lifespan effect; and removing the spleens of mice altogether at age 97 weeks increased median remaining lifespan from 118 to 158 weeks, a 19% lifespan effect.
Clearly, the aged mouse spleen contains some factor that accelerates age-related decline. The obvious question is to find out what this is, through expression or proteomics studies on young, aged, and splenectomized mice, and see if there’s a way to target the culprit pharmacologically.
Induced Hypothyroidism: 17% Life Extension in Rats 
Exposing newborn rats to thyroid hormone permanently reduces their bodyweight and thyroxine levels; it’s a way of artificially inducing hypothyroidism.[13] It also has the effect of dramatically elevating their prolactin levels; as prolactin is stimulated by TSH release from the hypothalamus, clearly neonatal T4 exposure doesn’t prevent TSH release in the brain, but rather impairs the thyroid’s ability to respond to it.  This induced hypothyroidism also extends median lifespan by 17% and maximal lifespan by 6%. 
Obviously, inducing hypothyroidism isn’t a viable intervention for humans, but looking at changes in hormone levels and gene regulation in induced hypothyroidism might give clues to what downstream mechanisms are responsible for the lifespan increase and whether there’s a less-side-effect-heavy way to induce it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Castration: 17% Life Extension in Rats&lt;/strong&gt; 
Removing the testes of male Wistar rats has been found to extend lifespan 17% relative to unbred intact males; removing the ovaries extends lifespan 29% relative to unbred females. [14] 
This isn’t too surprising given that caloric restriction (a reliable life-extending intervention in rodents under typical lab conditions) has antigonadal effects, and that extremely dramatic lifespan effects can come from removing the germ cells in C. elegans.[15] There’s also some correlational evidence – for instance, castrated male cats arriving at veterinary hospitals lived 67% longer than intact males.[16]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, castration isn’t a practical intervention for most humans, but it’s possible that there’s some downstream effect that doesn’t alter fertility or observable sex characteristics and preserves some of the anti-aging effect; this is a good opportunity for looking at longitudinal expression changes in castrated vs. intact animals and trying to identify the mechanism of lifespan extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lateral Hypothalamic Stimulation: 5% Life Extension in Aged Rats&lt;/strong&gt; 
Stimulating the lateral hypothalamus is pleasurable, and animals given the opportunity to self-stimulate will do so; this is what’s known as wireheading.  Interestingly enough, there are interactions with aging here as well.  Young adult rats have more neurons and more electrical activity in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) than old rats; young rats also exhibit more self-stimulatory behavior than old rats when given access to a button that turns on the electrode. Moreover, in old rats, chronic stimulation in the LHA extended lifespan from 1075 days to 1125 days (5% of total median lifespan, 8% of total maximum lifespan, 35% of residual lifespan); stimulation reduced body mass as well.[17] 
Is this just a dietary restriction effect, or is it something else? The natural thing to do is to try the experiment again, this time compared against controls given the exact same amount of food to eat; and also, to take brain samples after death and possibly other blood samples during lifespan to try to identify metabolic or regulatory changes caused by the stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blindness: Increases Survival in Rats&lt;/strong&gt; 
Blindness affects the circadian rhythm; it effectively gives the same hormonal signals as perpetual darkness. Rats blinded at 25 days had increased lifespan relative to controls; at 748 days, when the experiment concluded, the blind rats had a 95% survival rate while the control rats had a 50% survival rate. 
The natural follow-up is to do a full lifespan study so we can get an actual measurement of the effect on median lifespan, as well as measurements of other biomarkers so we can identify a mechanism and possibly a way to replicate the anti-aging effect without actually inducing blindness.
Fetal Hypothalmic Graft: Restores Fertility and Circadian Rhythm in Rats and Hamsters 
In keeping with the pattern of neuroendocrine effects on aging, it turns out that transplanting the suprachiasmatic nucleus (the part of the hypothalamus responsible for entraining the circadian rhythm in response to day length) from fetal animals into the brains of aged animals can restore the periodicity of the circadian rhythm and restore diminished fertility. With age, circadian rhythms become less regular; animals wake more during the periods when they should be sleeping, and/or are more lethargic during the periods when they should be awake.  Fetal SCN grafts reverse this phenomenon in both hamsters [18] and rats.[19] 
Moreover, 7 of 10 aged rats given fetal anterior hypothalamus transplants regained fertility and fathered a total of 106 pups[20], while medial basal hypothalamus transplants from rat fetuses into aged female rats reversed hypogonadism.[21]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hypothalamus regulates a variety of hormonal signals, which become dysregulated with age; it seems that some of these effects can be reversed by transplanting a younger hypothalamus. The most natural question to ask is, first, does this extend life? Second, can we identify on the genetic or molecular level what the younger hypothalamus tissue is doing that improves aging-related phenotypes? If so, there might be a non-invasive way to replicate the effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are ten very broad suggestions for animal experiments to run, which might yield targets that are ripe for intervention.  I’d expect, without looking too deeply into details, that each of these ten experiments would have a 6-figure price tag. And I’m aware of nobody who’s working on these projects (please correct me if I’m wrong!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could these projects turn into biotech companies? It’s hard to say, of course; it depends on whether the experimental results are good, among other things. But I’m pretty inclined to believe that we don’t know all the aging-modulating targets yet. That points to phenotypic screening approaches (like what we’re doing at Daphnia Labs) or target-discovery studies (like the ones proposed in this post, or like the ones being done at Gordian, BioAge, or Fauna), being quite valuable. We don’t know everything that’s out there, and early-stage exploration is a lot cheaper than depth-first drug development, so on the margin more exploration is a “good buy”, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
