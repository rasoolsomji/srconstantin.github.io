&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s In A COVID-19 Antibody Test?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of April 24, there are 4 COVID-19 antibody tests approved for diagnostic purposes in the US, and 44 approved for diagnostic or research purposes around the world.[1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these are ELISA tests, which detect the presence of antibodies to viral proteins, such as the N (nucleocapsid) protein or S (spike) protein.  The subject’s blood serum is incubated with the protein, and then washed with antibody-dye conjugates that fluoresce in proportion to the concentration of bound antibody/viral protein complexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some tests, such as one approved in Singapore, is a viral neutralization assay that tests the patient’s serum for its ability to neutralize viral replication in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, some are rapid tests, which screen for the presence or absence of antibodies to the viral protein, but cannot measure the concentration. These can be very quick (&amp;lt;15 min) to perform, but tell us nothing about the concentration of the antibody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viral neutralization tests, compared to ELISA can tell us more about how likely the antibodies are to protect against infection, but they also take longer than ELISA tests (3-5 days vs 1-5 hours.)&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese-designed IgM/IgG combined assay for COVID-19 (Jiangsu Medomics)  testing for antibodies against the receptor binding domain of the spike protein, tested on confirmed COVID-19 cases selected from hospitals in 6 different provinces and healthy volunteers, had a sensitivity of 88.66% and a specificity of 90.63%.[2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A German-designed IgG/IgA assay against the spike protein S1 of SARS-CoV-2 (Euroimmun) had a 100% specificity (did not react against healthy volunteers, patients with non-coronavirus viruses, or patients with endemic coronaviruses that cause the common cold.  All 3 SARS-CoV-2 patients got positive tests, for a specificity of 100%. 2/2 SARS-CoV patients also got positive results from this antibody test.  More severe patients had higher antibody titers.[3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Swedish preprint study evaluating a Chinese-made rapid antibody test (Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech) on 29 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients or convalescents and 100 healthy controls had a sensitivity of 93.1% and specificity of 99.2% for the IgG test. The IgM test had only a 69% sensitivity but a 100% specificity. [4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese preprint study of RBD antibody kits for combined IgA/IgG antibodies on 330 healthy subjects, 153 patients with non-COVID-19 diseases, and 87 SARS-CoV-2 cases, had a sensitivity of 99.1% and specificity of 100%. IgA levels but not IgM levels were higher in more severe patients (p &amp;lt; 0.0001).[5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ELISA test against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, developed at Mount Sinai Hospital in the US and approved for diagnostic use, was tested on 17 confirmed COVID-19 cases (3 convalescent, 14 acute) and 94 negative controls collected before the COVID-19 pandemic began.  All 17 COVID-19 patients had antibodies that reacted strongly in the test, while none of the controls did.  Additionally, the concentration of antibody correlates positively to viral neutralization ability (p &amp;lt;0.0001, r = 0.9279).[6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An independent Danish preprint study of 9 antibody tests on 30 confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to the ICU and 82 non-COVID-19 patients (healthy blood donors or people with other acute viral infections) found that the Wantai test for the spike protein receptor binding domain had a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 100%, while the Euroimmun IgA test had a specificity of 93% and sensitivity of 93%.  Point-of-care rapid tests were less sensitive – the Dynamiker and CTK Biotech tests (both IgG/IgM tests) had sensitivities of 90% and specificities of 100%. The best two ELISA tests agreed 93% with each other.[7]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Briefer illnesses (7-13 days vs 14-20 and &amp;gt;21 days) had somewhat lower rates of positive test results, which is consistent with other studies finding that more severe disease correlated with higher antibody levels. [7]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A German study of an unnamed rapid IgG/IgM test on 39 randomly selected patients who were also tested for COVID-19 with RT-PCR (the benchmark), the sensitivity was only 36.4% while the specificity was 88.9%.  (Note that this could include patients who were in the early stages of the disease, when viral RNA is detectable but antibodies are not.)[8]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Italian study of the Beijing Diagreat Biotechnologies rapid IgG/IgM test on 30 patients admitted to the hospital with either confirmed COVID-19, suspected COVID-19 that turned out to be something else, or asymptomatic controls, the sensitivity was 83% and the specificity was 93%.[9]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A novel type of immunoassay, LIPS (Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System) was  tested on 49 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 32 blood bank donor controls. None of the controls had a positive result for nucleocapsid antibodies, while 67% of the COVID-19 patients did.  Similarly, none of the controls had a positive result for spike protein antibodies, while 57% of the COVID-19 patients did.  When restricted to samples taken &amp;gt;14 days after symptom onset, the sensitivity and specificity were 100%.[10]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Premarket testing for the Cellex rapid IgG/IgM test evaluated 128 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 250 negative subjects, and found a sensitivity of 93.8% and a specificity of 96.0%.[11]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VITROS modified ELISA test against spike protein was positive in 30/36 patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 (sensitivity of 83%) and negative in 100% of 400 non-COVID-19 samples.[12]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bottom Lines&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the antibody tests are generally quite specific (at least in patients who have had the disease for at least two weeks) and fairly sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antibody levels tend to rise over the course of the disease and tend to be higher in more severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Should We Interpret The Antibody Seroprevalence Data in the US?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several recent papers have come out with estimates of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in US cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCR Tests of Random Samples in the US&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of 131 patients presenting with mild influenza-like symptoms in a Los Angeles clinic, 7 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, or 5%.[13]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between March 22 and April 4, all pregnant women delivering at New York Presbyterian and Columbia University hospitals in New York were tested for COVID-19. 15.4% of all pregnant women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.   Only 12% of the patients who tested positive had COVID-19 symptoms, consistent with a picture in which most infections are asymptomatic.[14]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A screening program of 24 homeless shelters in Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, and Atlanta found 25% of residents and 11% of staff members tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.  This is probably much higher than the general population in those cities since homeless people are sicker than others and living in institutional environments like shelters spreads disease.[20]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCR Tests of Random Samples In Other Countries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iceland did an extensive testing program for SARS-CoV-2, issuing an open invitation to 10,797 people and random invitations to 2283 people.  In total, 6% of the Icelandic population was screened.  0.6% of the open invitation group and 0.8% of the random invitation group tested positive for the virus.  57% of those who tested positive also reported symptoms of COVID-19.[16]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study testing 1097 health care workers with mild respiratory symptoms in 9 hospitals in the Netherlands found that 4% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.[17]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A screening study for SARS-CoV-2 in 1654 UK medical staff with symptoms of cough or fever found 14% tested positive.[22]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea has one of the largest COVID-19 testing programs in the world, testing 601,660 people between January 3 and April 27, or about 1% of its population. 1.8% of those tested were positive, and 2.3% of the confirmed cases were fatal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antibody Tests in the US&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study that recruited participants in Santa Clara County, California through Facebook ads tested 3330 participants with a rapid IgG/IgM test (Premier Biotech.)  This test had previously been found to have an 80% sensitivity rate and 99.5% specificity rate, from combining the manufacturer’s data and an independent experiment, 523 patients in all.[15]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crude prevalence rate of antibodies in Santa Clara County was 1.5%; after weighting the sample to match Santa Clara County by zipcode, race, and sex, the rate was 2.81%.  Adjusting for the sensitivity and specificity of the test, the estimated prevalence is 2.75%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors conclude that, because the prevalence of antibodies is much higher than the number of confirmed cases (there were 985 confirmed cases in Santa Clara County, while this study’s data suggests 48,000-81,000 cases should exist), that COVID-19 is almost always asymptomatic and should have a much lower case fatality rate than previously assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think this conclusion is reasonable.  Confirmed case numbers were low for a long time in the US, even when the pandemic was spreading rapidly, because there was a shortage of tests before the FDA approved several new tests.  Even a serious case of suspected COVID-19 can’t get a diagnostic confirmation if no tests are available.  It makes more sense to suppose that the confirmed case numbers (and, thus, the confirmed fatality numbers) are underestimates than to take those numbers literally and infer that the disease kills only 0.1-0.2% of those infected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miami-Dade County in Florida has embarked on a random antibody screening program, and preliminary results from 1800 individuals indicate a rate of 6%, which is 16.5x higher than the number of confirmed cases captured by hospitals and testing sites alone.[24] About half of the individuals who tested positive had no symptoms.[25]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A random antibody test of New York State residents sampled from shoppers at grocery and big-box stores found 21% in New York City, 17% in Long Island, 12% in Westchester, and &amp;lt;4% in the rest of the state, had antibodies to the virus.[26]  These numbers may be overestimates because people who are shopping are less likely to be practicing social distancing and thus are more at risk for infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preliminary results from a random antibody screening program in Los Angeles County found that 4.1% of residents tested positive for SARS-CoV-19 antibodies.[29]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antibody Tests in Other Countries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1000 blood samples from blood donors in Scotland were screened for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies; 0.5% tested positive. Note that blood donors are healthier on average than the general population, since donors with a history of recent respiratory infection are turned away; so this serves as more of a lower bound on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the Scottish population.[19]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other Measurements of Prevalence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 levels in the wastewater of a major water treatment facility in Massachussetts suggest that roughly 5% of the stool samples in the state were positive for the virus between March 18-25, a number much higher than the 0.026% prevalence rate for confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Massachusetts. This points towards COVID-19 being underdiagnosed, as we’d expect given the shortage of tests.[18]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A New York Times report on April 27th observed that New York City had triple the number of all-cause deaths compared to historical baselines, and other countries also had higher rates of all-cause mortality than their historical baselines. (Spain, 67% above normal; Equador, 83% above normal; Jakarta, Indonesia, 57% above normal.) These numbers can’t be confounded by any possible over-diagnosis of COVID-19, and constitute clear evidence that the epidemic is killing people. Moreover, there are more all-cause deaths than can be accounted for by confirmed COVID-19 deaths alone; so either the disease is underdiagnosed or people are dying from other effects of the pandemic (such as a shortage of hospital care.)[21]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2020, the number of LA County cases of influenza-like symptoms was double that in March of the past 4 years, despite it being past the peak of flu season.[13]  This likewise points to COVID-19 causing a large number of symptomatic cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most screens of random population samples – that is, _not _specifically selected for having symptoms or for having contacts with COVID-19 – seem to show 0.5-5% prevalence for the disease, in different cities and countries, whether measured by antibodies, viral RNA, or even wastewater RNA concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prevalence numbers are higher among high-risk populations (healthcare workers and homeless people) and _much _higher in New York City, the center of the US epidemic and a very dense population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US specifically, where testing has been scarce, this means that the number of confirmed cases has been underestimated by at least an order of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The antibody screening experiments have been criticized on the grounds that antibody tests are not perfectly accurate. I don’t think this is a valid argument against the main point (that there are probably &amp;gt;10x as many true cases as confirmed cases in the US.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antibody tests vary in their _sensitivity _(how likely they are to give a positive result in a real infection) and tend to not show up as positive until 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms.  But, if anything, this should mean the true positive rate is even _larger _than the numbers in the studies. Antibody tests tend to have fairly high _specificity _– the maximum % of false positives I’ve seen reported is 10% – and so even if 10% of the reported positives are false ones, that would still mean that the seroprevalence of COVID-19 is many times higher than the rate of confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some commentators have concluded that this means that the danger of COVID-19 has been overstated; that the risk of dying given a SARS-CoV-19 infection is much lower than previously supposed.  I think this is misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official case fatality rate (# of confirmed COVID-19 deaths/ # of confirmed COVID-19 cases) may be an overestimate, because when testing is scarce, more severe cases are more likely to be tested. Right now the cumulative global case fatality rate is a whopping 7% and the US case fatality rate is 2.8%.[27][28]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, estimating an infection fatality rate defined by # of confirmed deaths / expected # of antibody-positive individuals is likely to be an &lt;em&gt;underestimate&lt;/em&gt;, since if testing capacity is scarce, we can expect even some fatal COVID-19 cases to go unconfirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These “optimistic” estimates of infection fatality rate are about 0.3% for Santa Clara County, 0.2% for L.A. County, 0.1% for Miami-Dade County, and 0.7% for New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we compare these estimates to two countries that had extensive COVID-19 testing, Iceland and South Korea, the cumulative case fatality rate for Iceland is 0.5% (in line with the optimistic US estimates) and the rate for South Korea is 2.3% (quite a bit higher than the optimistic US estimates.)  So it’s not clear what conclusion to draw from international comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One consideration is that the South Korean testing program is not a random sample of the population, though it was extensive – people with symptoms or connections to COVID-19 patients are prioritized for testing.  So its 2.3% mortality rate may be an overestimate as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we consider the 3x elevated all-cause mortality rate in NYC, and assume that _all _excess deaths are COVID-19 deaths, and that 21% of New Yorkers are infected, this gives a “pessimistic” estimate of 1.2% of COVID-19 infections being fatal in NYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current best guess is that the true estimate of infection fatality rate in the US is somewhere between the “optimistic” and “pessimistic” probabilities, i.e. between 0.1% and 1.2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is still not, by any means, &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. If the US ended all quarantines today, without a vaccine or effective treatment, and allowed the virus to spread until herd immunity was achieved, or about 60% of the US population, this would mean about 200,000-2,000,000 deaths this year.  On the high end, that’s as deadly per capita as the US Civil War,[30] and deadlier than the Spanish Flu.[31]  “Less deadly than previously estimated” does not mean “no big deal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do Viral Antibodies Generally Correspond to Past Viral Infection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of COVID-19, what’s the track record of accuracy of viral antibody tests?  Are there a sizable population who have positive antibodies to viruses they were never infected with?  Do many people get infected with viruses that they never develop antibodies to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can put the credibility of antibody tests for COVID-19 in a broader context. If antibody false positives are really common overall, then the apparently good specificity of the COVID-19 tests (derived from small studies, often by the manufacturers) may be too optimistic, and the actual prevalence of COVID-19 may be quite a bit lower than it appears in the antibody screening studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ELISA test and rapid antibody test for dengue virus, tested in 138 Vietnamese patients admitted to the ICU with clinical suspicion of dengue, had sensitivities of 83.2% and 73.8% respectively, and specificities of 100%.[32]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study of antibody tests for dengue virus on 225 patients from around the world, some with dengue, some with other viruses, and some healthy controls, the ELISA tests for NS1 antigen had sensitivities of 60-75% in acute cases and 19-31% in convalescent cases, and the rapid tests had sensitivities of 40-60% in acute cases and 12-59% in convalescent cases.  The anti-dengue IgM ELISA test had a sensitivity of 98% in both acute and convalescent cases, while the anti-dengue IgM rapid tests had a sensitivity of 45-95 in both acute and convalescent cases.  The specificity of NS1 tests was 71-80%, and the IgM ELISA test had a specificity of 84%.[33]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 rapid tests for HCV (hepatitis C) on 1083 samples: all specificities over 99.5%, sensitivities were 97.8%, 88.3%, 99.3%[34]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6 rapid tests for HIV on 6282 study participants, compared to a gold standard of Western blot, ELISA, &amp;amp; treatment status.  All sensitivities were &amp;gt;95% and specificities were &amp;gt;99%.[35]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study of an IgG/IgM ELISA test for Zika virus, on 112 patients with RT-PCR confirmed or suspected Zika, 1015 healthy patients, and 252 patients with other viruses, the sensitivity of combined IgG and IgM tests was 100% and specificity was 100%.[36]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two rapid tests for chikungunya virus, tested on 132 patients with confirmed chikungunya and 74 patients with a different febrile illness; one had a 20.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity, while the other had a 50.8% sensitivity and 89.2% specificity.[37]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study of 524 patients tested for H5N1 (avian flu) a rapid test had a sensitivity of 18.2% and an ELISA test had a sensitivity of 38.7%.  Both had specificities of 100%.[38]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the performance of antibody tests for different viruses depends on the test itself, most have high specificities.  There is no reason to suppose that the measured specificity levels for SARS-CoV-2 tests are unrealistically low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do Viral Antibodies Generally Predict Immunity to Future Infection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CDC has been saying there’s “no evidence” that antibodies in recovered patients indicate immunity to COVID-19.[39] It’s too soon to tell whether this is true for COVID-19, but do antibody levels predict viral immunity in other viruses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a longitudinal cohort of 7547 Nicaraguan children monitored for dengue virus, preinfection antibody titer correlated with lower risk of having a symptomatic second infection (p &amp;lt; 0.005).  Children with serologically confirmed but asymptomatic second infections had preinfection antibody titers 2.3-fold higher than children with symptomatic second infections.  Also, children with symptomatic first infections were less likely to have symptomatic second infections independent of antibody titer – apparently infection grants immunity through mechanisms other than antibody quantity.[40]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 17 infants born to mothers with HSV1 or HSV2 infections during pregnancy, the babies with milder (or asymptomatic) infections had higher neutralizing antibody titers at birth than the babies with severe cases.  Average titer was 1:13 for severe cases, 1:65 for mild cases, and 1:69 for asymptomatic cases.[41]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine studies of human volunteers previously infected with influenza in the 60’s and 70’s and challenged with exposure to an influenza virus found that _no _volunteers developed symptomatic illness after challenge, out of a total of 86 patients.  “The titer of serum anti-HA antibodies remains the most consistent correlate of immunity to influenza virus infection.”[42]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a cohort of 200 Mexican infants monitored for rotavirus, children with higher (&amp;gt; 1:800) rotavirus IgA titers were less likely to have rotavirus infection (RR = 0.21, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and rotavirus diarrhea (RR = 0.16, p &amp;lt; 0.01) and never got severe diarrhea.[43]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1164 healthy children immunized with varicella vaccine, children with lower antibody titers after the vaccine (&amp;lt;5 gpELISA units) were 3.5x as likely to develop a varicella infection in the next 7 years as children with higher antibody titers (&amp;gt;5 gpELISA units.)[44]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study of 38 adults challenged with rotavirus, patients who got ill from the exposure had higher preinoculation rotavirus IgG antibody (7.3 vs 6.1, p = 0.041).  There was no significant difference in infection rate between those exposed to a larger vs. smaller quantity.[45]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study of 696 adults and children in rural Bangladesh, serum IgG rotavirus antibodies were on average 4x higher in cases of symptomatic rotavirus than healthy controls.[46]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 33 volunteers experimentally infected with human coronavirus 223E, those who had higher antibody titers prior to exposure were much less likely to get symptomatic disease (average ELISA ratio for neutralizing antibodies was 6.5x higher in the affected group vs the unaffected group, p &amp;lt;0.001)  Those who had had a cold in the last six months had significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) lower clinical scores than those who had not.[47]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have very consistent results across all viruses studied indicating that yes, higher pre-challenge virus-specific antibody titers are predictive of lower rates of symptomatic disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t know yet whether reinfection of people previously infected with COVID-19 is _ever _possible, but we _do _have evidence from other viruses suggesting that if you’ve recovered successfully from a COVID-19 illness you are _less _susceptible to getting a symptomatic disease if you’re exposed again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Variolation refers to a historical precursor of vaccination used for smallpox. Healthy subjects were inoculated with material from the scabs of smallpox patients, which usually gave them a mild version of the disease and protected them from contracting the full disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By analogy, is it possible that a low-dose exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus could result in a mild illness and immunity to subsequently contracting the disease?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are Low Doses of COVID-19 Virus Safer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One (imperfect) proxy for this question is whether lower viral titers of SARS-CoV-2 correspond to less severe disease.  It seems intuitively plausible – smaller quantities of the virus in the body might be easier for the immune system to fight off and/or cause less extensive tissue damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at viral RNA titers in COVID-19 patients doesn’t tell us whether they were initially exposed to large or small amounts of virus, though. If there’s a correlation between viral titer and disease severity, it could either be because the sicker patients got a higher initial “dose” of virus, or because the virus was more successful at multiplying in them.  However, we can somewhat alleviate this ambiguity by looking at the trajectories of virus titer over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A retrospective study of 76 Chinese patients found that viral loads (as measured by nasal swab) were significantly higher in severe than mild cases of COVID-19, p &amp;lt; 0.005. All patients’ viral loads followed a similar trajectory over time – they started high and steadily declined.  However, severe cases had detectable levels of virus for much longer – all severe cases still had viral RNA after 10 days from disease onset, while most mild cases were virus-free by 10 days.[1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viral load does not correlate perfectly with disease.  Asymptomatic patients [2][3] can have similar viral loads to sick ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another, smaller study with 23 COVID-19 patients found a significant association of peak viral load with age but no significant association of either initial or peak viral load with disease severity.[4]  The correlation of viral load with age is explainable by immunosenescence (aging weakens the immune system) and tells us that higher viral load can be caused by a weaker immune system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the SARS epidemic, healthcare workers who were exposed to one of three index patients and tested positive for SARS were significantly more likely to be asymptomatic if they wore masks, which suggests that masks lower the amount of virus exposure and that lower virus exposure results in less severe disease.[5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another study of 16 individuals exposed to a single SARS index patient showed that the healthcare workers, who were wearing PPE, had significantly lower viral load than the non-healthcare workers, who had no masks. The non-healthcare workers were also more likely to have severe disease, but they were also older on average.[7]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among people with exposure to a SARS index patient, they were significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.001) more likely to get SARS the longer the index patient stayed home after the onset of fever; when the patient stayed home for &amp;gt;6 days, as opposed to &amp;lt;=2 days, the risk of getting the disease jumps from 38% to 66%.  You were more likely to get the disease if you shared a room and bed with the index patient, if you dined more frequently with the index patient, and if you had more frequent close contact with the index patient.  This indicates that the volume of contact with the SARS virus influences the risk of contracting disease.[8]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Higher initial viral load is also associated with worse prognosis and shorter survival times in SARS.[6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence is relatively sparse but consistent with the hypothesis that lower volumes of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV result in lower viral titers and less severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is COVID-19 Reinfection Possible?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deliberately infecting a human with a low dose of virus, of course, has not been done enough for there to be a research literature about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what happens when we do it with animals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have mixed results on reinfection in animals, some studies showing that prior exposure to a coronavirus protects against subsequent infection, while others showed that reinfection can indeed occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rhesus monkeys that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 do not get reinfected after a second challenge; they do not show viral replication or clinical symptoms.[15]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mice who have previously been exposed to SARS-CoV are protected from disease for at least 28 days. Serum from mice that had previously been exposed to the virus, injected into SARS-naive mice, also had a protective effect, while serum from non-exposed mice did not.[12]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferrets infected with SARS-CoV who were reinfected 4 weeks later did not have as high viral titers upon reinfection and did not show lung histopathology.[14]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alpacas and camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV are protected against reinfection.[17]  On the other hand, a longitudinal study of a camel herd showed that reinfection can occur in camels who have previously acquired antibodies to MERS-CoV.[18]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reinfection is possible in cats previously exposed to feline coronavirus [19], and in cows with bovine coronavirus [20].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exposure to an inactivated form of a virus is a standard type of vaccine, and it has been found effective in rodents for SARS-CoV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partially inactivated SARS-CoV virus samples (treated with formaldehyde) were no longer able to replicate in vitro. When mice were treated with this inactivated virus (by injection or intranasal administration) they produced detectable antibody responses.[9][10]  SARS-CoV virus inactivated with UV radiation also produced an antibody response in mice.[11]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whole killed SARS-CoV vaccine (inactivated with beta-propiolactone)  protected mice against a challenge infection.[13]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamsters immunized with beta-propiolactone inactivated SARS-CoV virus had lower virus titers than non-immunized hamsters upon challenge with active SARS-CoV and had less severe lung lesions than non-immunized hamsters.[16]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been reports of reinfected COVID-19 patients in China and Japan[21] but some think that these are due to testing errors where the patients erroneously tested as having recovered when they were still infected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current state of evidence hasn’t ruled out that reinfection could occur for SARS-CoV-2, but tentatively it seems more likely that people who have been infected once are protected against further infections for some period of time. The duration of protection, and whether there are any individuals who don’t get immunological protection, is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s reason to believe that exposure to a lower dose of the SARS-CoV-2 virus produces a milder disease than exposure to larger quantities of SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there’s reason to believe that people who have recovered from COVID-19 have some protection against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we _don’t _know is whether a dose low enough not to cause severe symptoms is also high enough to cause immune protection against subsequent infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deliberate Exposure as a Policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trial of deliberate exposure of young, healthy volunteers to COVID-19 has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/04/variolation-test-design.html&quot;&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; by Robin Hanson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case for deliberate exposure is to produce a population of immune people who don’t have to be quarantined – for instance, so that they can continue to work as healthcare workers, janitors, and other essential employees in a mostly housebound economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside, of course, is that deliberately infecting people with a disease harms them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deliberate exposure looks better relative to other options under certain conditions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if deliberate exposure causes little harm to the exposed (either because the dose is low or because young people rarely get severe disease)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if reinfection after safe doses of virus is rare or impossible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if exposure to the active virus is much easier and/or more effective than alternative, safer types of immune protection (like convalescent serum or inactivated virus)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if containing the virus is expected to be impossible (i.e. most people will get the disease, the question is when) or so costly that countries decide it’s not worth continuing the lockdowns.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if developing an effective vaccine or treatment is expected to be slow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am doubtful about the first three conditions.  We don’t know much about what a “safe” dose of SARS-CoV-2 is, and we haven’t fully ruled out reinfection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And young people, while less vulnerable than older people, are not immune from severe COVID-19 – in New York, 9% of patients age 18-44 had to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/young-people-coronavirus-new-york-city-percentage-patients-covid-19-symptoms-dying-hospitalizations/&quot;&gt;hospitalized.&lt;/a&gt;  For any given young person, it might be safer to try to stay home and avoid getting the disease until a vaccine or treatment can be developed than to risk deliberate exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An animal study prior to a human one can identify what the infectious dose of the virus is, as well as what the minimum active dose to produce an immune response and protection against reinfection is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it seems that it would be safer, and not obviously less effective, to treat healthy subjects with convalescent serum or inactivated virus rather than live virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As COVID-19 sweeps the world, there are more patients who have severe cases of respiratory failure than there are ICU beds and ventilator machines to help them breathe.  Doctors have been forced to find creative solutions to the crisis – and they’re turning to a technique called CPAP, which is gaining credence as a treatment for severe COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CPAP stands for continuous positive airway pressure, and refers to a device that blows a steady stream of air into the lungs (which may be supplemented with extra oxygen) to help patients who have moderate difficulty breathing independently.  It may reduce the need for ventilation, which is crucial when ventilators are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00926-4&quot;&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reports on a team of clinicians from the UK, China, and Italy using a CPAP device, now being used in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m1294.full&quot;&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; at University College London Hospital.  These machines have been widely used in Italy, where they prevented the need for ventilation in 50% of patients. (A prospective study on the effectiveness of CPAP on COVID-19 in Italy is &lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04307459?term=covid-19+cpap&amp;amp;draw=2&quot;&gt;ongoing&lt;/a&gt;; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://srconstantin.github.io/2020/03/22/non-invasive-ventilation.html&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, non-invasive ventilation such as CPAP successfully avoided the need for invasive ventilation in 77% of treated patients.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/tech/mercedes-f1-breathing-aid-coronavirus/index.html&quot;&gt;Mercedes F1&lt;/a&gt; engineers designed the device, which can be quickly mass produced and has been recommended for use by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US, Elon Musk has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-elon-musk-cpap-ventilator-coronavirus/&quot;&gt;donating CPAP/BiPAP machines&lt;/a&gt; to hospitals; these machines can be converted into ventilators if necessary, or used as-is on patients with milder respiratory distress to prevent them needing invasive (and scarce) mechanical ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CPAP and BiPAP for respiratory disorders are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/27/822211604/cpap-machines-were-seen-as-ventilator-alternatives-but-could-spread-covid-19&quot;&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt;, as they are considered “aerosol generating procedures” that could spread particles of the virus around. However, evidence suggests that these non-invasive ventilation procedures actually produce &lt;a href=&quot;https://srconstantin.github.io/2020/03/22/contagion-risk-from-NIV.html&quot;&gt;droplets rather than aerosols&lt;/a&gt;, larger particles which usually land less than one meter from the patient, and CPAP masks don’t leak much exhaled air (less than a meter away from the patient) when the mask is a good fit, as a 2019 Hong Kong study &lt;a href=&quot;https://sci-hub.tw/10.1183/13993003.02339-2018&quot;&gt;showed.&lt;/a&gt;  ResMed, the leading manufacturer of CPAP machines, recommends that they be used in COVID-19 patients only when caregivers have protective equipment such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.resmed.com/en-us/covid-19/?utm_source=vanity&amp;amp;utm_medium=print&amp;amp;utm_content=covid19&amp;amp;utm_campaign=covid19-update&quot;&gt;N95 masks and eye protection.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the WHO’s guidance on treatment of &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331446/WHO-2019-nCoV-clinical-2020.4-eng.pdf&quot;&gt;COVID-19 &lt;/a&gt;acknowledges a place for CPAP and BiPAP machines.  The document recommends patients be given non-invasive ventilation only in monitored circumstances where they can be intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation if their condition worsens, but it still offers CPAP as an option, particularly in the case of children in low-resource settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FDA’s new guidance on COVID-19 clears the way for modifying respiratory support devices without needing to get the modifications separately approved, including the use of CPAP machines in COVID-19: __&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;_Wherever possible, health care facilities should use FDA-cleared conventional/standard full- featured ventilators when necessary to support patients with respiratory failure, or a device subject to an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), if any. However, to help ensure the availability of the greatest possible number of devices for this purpose, and as described in more detail below, FDA does not intend to object to limited modifications to the indications, claims, functionality, or to the hardware, software, or materials of FDA-cleared devices used to support patients with respiratory failure or respiratory insufficiency, without prior submission of a premarket notification under section 510(k) of the FD&amp;amp;C Act and 21 CFR 807.81 , for the duration of the declared public health emergency…_


_Examples of circumstances where FDA currently believes a modification would not create such undue risk include:_


_1) The use of powered emergency ventilators and anesthesia gas machines for patients needing mechanical ventilation; _


_2) The use of ventilators outside their cleared environment of use (for example, use of a ventilator in a health care facility when it is only cleared for use at home or during transport);_


_3) **The use of devices indicated for sleep apnea (including noncontinuous ventilators delivering continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP)) to treat patients with respiratory insufficiency, provided that appropriate design mitigations are in place to minimize aerosolization**;_


_4) The use of oxygen concentrators for primary supply when medically necessary and clinically appropriate._
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time to give CPAP for COVID-19 a second look. Yes, it can disperse air, but the evidence that it spreads disease particles is ambiguous at best; and the risks can be mitigated by using full-face masks with good seals, using filters on the exhaust vents, and making sure medical staff have adequate protective equipment. We know from past pandemics and some early retrospective data in COVID-19 that a sizable fraction of patients improve on CPAP alone without intubation; in a world where invasive ventilation may not be an option for an overwhelmed healthcare system, that means saving lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="covid-19" /><category term="lit-review" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Comprehensive PPE Project List</title><link href="/2020/04/03/Comprehensive-PPE-Project-List.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Comprehensive PPE Project List" /><published>2020-04-03T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-04-03T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>/2020/04/03/Comprehensive-PPE-Project-List</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2020/04/03/Comprehensive-PPE-Project-List.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/face_shield.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;shield&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The COVID19 crisis has caused a severe shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers. Masks, face shields, respirators, and other supplies help keep the people who care for COVID19 patients from getting sick themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s been a huge outpouring of effort to fix this shortage, by manufacturers, makers, donors, and volunteers. But as of yet, I haven’t seen anything approaching a comprehensive list of who is active in this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my best attempt at aggregating all the open-source designs for personal protective equipment (PPE), manufacturers and DIY maker groups currently scaling up their production of PPE, and coordination/distribution efforts to get PPE to the health care workers who need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a hardware engineer or experienced maker, so I have made no attempt to evaluate these designs myself. I do NOT vouch for the quality of any of these designs. I do mention when a design has already been in use in hospitals, been tested by medical professionals, been certified by a governing body, etc. The only designs I’m putting in the “Bad Ideas” section are those that I’ve seen specific criticism of (e.g. from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.helpfulengineering.org/&quot;&gt;Helpful Engineering &lt;/a&gt;team.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because I have not listed a design under “Bad Ideas” does not mean it is a good idea!  If you are considering manufacturing PPE, use your own critical judgment to choose a design!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, I have not vetted the charities on this list. I make no claims about their competence or integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little good news on the COVID-19 front: yes, you can kill the virus on surfaces, with easily available disinfectants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper surfaces, silver particles, alcohol-based disinfectants, and UV light will kill the virus.  Frequently touched items, especially in public places, should probably just be irradiated with UVC light and/or coated with copper as a routine prevention measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Regular UV light is an effective disinfectant but can also blind people and burn skin; UVC is a shorter wavelength, equally effective against microbes but not harmful to eyes or skin.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do Copper Surfaces Kill/Inactivate Coronaviruses?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an experiment with aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, at 21-23 degrees C and 40% humidity, both reached undetectable levels within 8 hours exposure to copper; by contrast, they lasted 72 hours on stainless steel and plastic.[1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H1N1 influenza, which was another pandemic virus, though not a coronavirus, lasted significantly less time on copper than stainless steel; 10^5 viable viruses after 24 hours on stainless steel vs. 10^2 viable viruses after 2 hours on copper.[2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human coronavirus 229E remains infectious on plastic, ceramic, glass, and stainless steel for at least 5 days, was inactivated in less than 5 minutes on copper and brass when applied dry, and inactivated in less than an hour when applied in solution to metal alloys containing &amp;gt;75% copper.[4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using copper-coated surfaces in real-world environments reduces microbial contamination. In 5 residential healthcare facilities, where half of the doorknobs and handrails were coated with copper alloys while half were not, the bacterial concentration was significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) lower on the copper-coated doorknobs and handrails.[5]  Similarly, when weights and grips in a gym were coated with copper alloy or left as rubber or stainless steel, the bacterial concentrations on the copper-coated surfaces were 94% lower than the controls.[6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silver Ion Zeolites as Anti-Microbial Surfaces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercially available silver zeolite powder (AgION powder, manufactured by Sinanen Co.) completely inactivated SARS-CoV at concentrations above 375 mg/L.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zeolites are fine, talc-like powders that can be incorporated into coatings to produce antimicrobial surfaces; the FDA has approved zeolites for use in food packaging.[3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disinfectants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study of 7 disinfectant liquids on the SARS coronavirus, including several with &amp;gt;80% ethanol as active ingredient, all of them significantly reduced SARS concentrations, by a factor of at least 1000.[7]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;70%+ ethanol was effective at reducing (by a factor of &amp;gt;1000) the infectivity of both SARS and MERS coronaviruses; so was 50%+ 2-propanol, hydrogen peroxide, glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, and povidone iodine. Chlorhexidine was not effective.[9]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study of human coronaviruses 229E and OC43, soap, bleach, and Proviodine (the active ingredient was iodine) all completely inactivated the viruses.[8]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Axe dishwashing detergent, sodium hypochlorite solution, and the disinfectant Virkon S, all killed SARS-CoV virus by a factor of at least 1000.[10]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against two coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus, a solution of 70% ethanol reduced viral infectivity by a factor of &amp;gt;1000; phenolic, sodium hypochlorite, and orthopthalaldehyde did not.[11]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UVC Radiation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exposure of SARS virus to UVC radiation for six minutes results in a 400-fold reduction in infectivity.  UVA and gamma radiation did not affect infectivity.[12]  Another study of SARS found 1000-fold inactivation from 15 minutes of exposure to UVC.[13]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study of Ebola virus and MERS virus found that UVC light at &amp;gt;0.1 J/cm^2 reduced infectivity more than 5000-fold in both.  Methylene blue plus light at &amp;gt;30 J/cm^2 also reduced infectivity 2000-fold in both.[14]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far-UVC light (207-222 nm) inactivates bacteria without harm to human skin.  It also reduces H1N1 infectivity by 100-fold at low doses: 2 mJ/cm^2.[15]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;222-nm far-UVC light applied to a mouse wound where MRSA bacteria had been spread reduced skin bacteria concentrations by &amp;gt;1000-fold, just like 254-nm conventional antimicrobial UV irradiation, but only the 254-nm light increased skin thickness significantly ( a measure of skin damage.)[16]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Should You Do For A Mild Case of COVID-19?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you, or someone in your household, has a flu-like or pneumonia-like illness that you suspect is COVID-19.  What can you do to increase your chances of getting well, and decrease your chances of getting sick enough to need a hospital?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This document doesn’t actually have a lot of answers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For respiratory infections not severe enough to need hospitalization, most medical guidelines advise identifying the pathogen, prescribing antivirals or antibiotics effective against that pathogen (we don’t know that much yet about which ones work for COVID-19), and otherwise practicing “supportive care” – rest, fluids, treating symptoms, avoiding infecting others.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supportive care often isn’t specified in studies, which is annoying, because it means we don’t have data on the effectiveness or potential disadvantages of over-the-counter medications to treat symptoms like fever and cough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this document, I am restricting attention to studies and reports of human subjects – no animal or in-vitro evidence – but I am including correlational evidence or even case reports, and I am including evidence from other diseases than COVID-19 where it seems that the result could translate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(For instance, I’m not including all the evidence about oseltamivir (Tamiflu) being effective against influenza, because it doesn’t seem to help with COVID-19; but I am including evidence about N-acetylcysteine preventing and reducing the severity of influenza, because NAC seems to work by generic immune-stimulatory effects rather than an effect specific to a particular virus.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to get tested by a doctor if you have a respiratory illness you think is COVID-19. Even if you can’t get access to a COVID-19 test, you might also have a different bacterial or viral infection (either instead of or in addition to COVID-19) which is treatable by antivirals or antibiotics. It’s very common for viral pneumonia to be complicated by an opportunistic bacterial infection, and killing the bacteria can help improve outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms of Mild COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common symptoms of mild COVID-19 are fever, cough, fatigue and muscle pain, and headache.  Other symptoms include sore throat, difficulty breathing, diarrhea, chest tightness, fear of cold, and sputum production.[1][2][4] Rash on the limbs is also possible.[3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rest and Fluids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like with any mild illness, public health departments are advising patients who have mild COVID-19 to get rest and drink fluids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t find experimental evidence for this but it makes sense and can’t hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanitation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WHO’s recommendations for home care for mild COVID-19 cases are primarily about avoiding infection for caregivers; patients should be in their own, well-ventilated room if possible, caregivers should wear masks and clean &amp;amp; disinfect surfaces daily, etc.[5]  There is no mention of how to optimize for recovery of the patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid Ibuprofen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France’s health minister has counseled patients with mild COVID-19 not to use ibuprofen or other NSAIDs to treat symptoms, after four young patients with the disease developed severe symptoms after using NSAIDs.  Patients were advised to take paracetamol instead.[6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid Corticosteroids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corticosteroids were associated with increased mortality and viral shedding in H1N1 viral pneumonia.[8]  Corticosteroids increased viral load in SARS.[11]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favipiravir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an open-label study, COVID-19 patients who took favipiravir had on average a shorter course of disease (4 days vs 12 days, p &amp;lt; 0.001) than those who took a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir.  All patients in the study also received interferon-alpha1b by aerosol inhalation, rehydration, electrolytes, antipyretics, analgesics, and antiemetics.[7]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a non-randomized study of 36 patients with COVID-19 treated with placebo, hydroxychloroquine, or hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine had a significantly higher rate of virological cure (p &amp;lt; 0.001) than placebo.  By day 6, 70% of hydroxychloroquine patients were cured, compared to 20% with placebo. With azithromycin + hydroxychloroquine, 100% of patients were cured by day 5.[10]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a Chinese study (reported by Bloomberg [12] because it’s in Chinese) of 30 patients given hydroxychloroquine or placebo found no difference in the rate of cure between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N-Acetylcysteine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a randomized trial of 262 elderly patients, assigned to N-acetylcysteine or placebo for 6 months, NAC significantly (p&amp;lt;0.01) reduced the incidence of influenza-like episodes, and significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.001) reduced the incidence of headache, muscle soreness, sore throat, and cough. In the NAC group, 25% of serologically confirmed H1N1 influenza cases were symptomatic, compared to 79% in the placebo group.[9]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air Quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a retrospective study in Utah hospitals, high concentrations of particulate matter in the air were associated with slightly but significantly higher (OR = 1.004) rates of admission to the emergency room for pneumonia, and slightly (OR = 1.02) but significantly higher rates of pneumonia mortality.[12] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having air filters in the home may be slightly protective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have a lot of planned COVID-19 lit review posts, but I’m going to take a quick break and go back to my sequence on psychology/cognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might recall that in &lt;a href=&quot;https://srconstantin.github.io/2020/02/21/tangled-thinking-1.html&quot;&gt;the first post in this sequence&lt;/a&gt; I laid out a framework where the content of our conscious minds is made up of &lt;strong&gt;mental objects&lt;/strong&gt;, much of what we do when we think, act, or perceive is a process of reconciling (apparent) &lt;strong&gt;conflicts&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;contradictions&lt;/strong&gt; between our mental objects, and &lt;strong&gt;suffering&lt;/strong&gt; is what we experience when we actively &lt;em&gt;refuse&lt;/em&gt; to resolve a contradiction or indeed deny its existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://srconstantin.github.io/2020/02/24/tangled-thinking-2.html&quot;&gt;second post&lt;/a&gt; I talked about &lt;strong&gt;motivated cognition&lt;/strong&gt;, which is defined as being motivated to have certain &lt;em&gt;beliefs&lt;/em&gt; rather than being motivated to achieve certain outcomes “out there” in the world. And I clarified that the problem with motivated cognition isn’t that people have motives, but that they’re in a sense motivated &lt;em&gt;about the wrong things&lt;/em&gt; – that it’s dysfunctional to turn your optimization power inward (believing things because you want to believe them) rather than outward (doing things because you want to do them.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That raises some new questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, how does motivated cognition (optimizing for what &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; mental experiences you want to have) relate to suffering (refusing to resolve contradictions)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, what do we even mean by internal vs. external?  Isn’t that kind of dualist? Why is it good to optimize for what you want to achieve in the external world, but bad to optimize for what kinds of internal mental states you want to have? A priori this isn’t a really principled distinction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can resolve both questions at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Out in the real world”, we saw in &lt;a href=&quot;https://srconstantin.github.io/2020/02/21/tangled-thinking-1.html&quot;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, from a subjective perspective, really just means “consistent with the experiences, mental objects, phenomena, etc, that I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; have, but haven’t had yet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t know anything, &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;, about the things I’m still ignorant of, by definition. Those are things that are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; currently mental objects in my mind. They are not in my model.  They are outside my current cognitive “world.”  The unknown. The out-of-frame. The unmapped Universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if I believe in the Universe, I believe that &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; I encounter these new, out-of-model, surprising things, I will eventually be able to reconcile them with all the &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; mental objects in my subjective “world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I am “optimizing for a state of reality”, or “having preferences about reality”, the things I have preferences about are still mental objects – mental objects are all I have subjective access to!  BUT, I am trying to achieve a setup of these mental objects that will &lt;em&gt;survive&lt;/em&gt; new discoveries, new data, ontology shifts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I try to fool myself, usually the false belief is &lt;em&gt;fragile&lt;/em&gt;. There is some new data I must not acquire because it would destabilize the belief. If I want to believe I can still make the train, I have to not check my watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what it means to not be optimizing for reality; you’re optimizing your subjective world in a fragile way, that would collapse completely if you explored even a little bit in the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Oscar Wilde said, “Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s actually a surprisingly deep statement. The delicacy, the fragility, is what &lt;em&gt;makes&lt;/em&gt; it ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it bad to try to be ignorant?  Well, “bad” may be the wrong word for it, but by our earlier definition of “suffering”, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; predict that some new discovery will ruin your desired mental state, and therefore that you must not look over there, then you already have something in your field of consciousness that is ruining or conflicting with your desired mental state.  But you’re trying to believe that it’s not &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt; ruining anything, so long as you don’t look at it. That’s having an internal contradiction and trying not to resolve it. That’s suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s anything in the world that you &lt;em&gt;remember&lt;/em&gt; not to pay attention to because it’ll upset you – let’s say you never read anything by a particular author – then, at the moment you choose to look away from the upsetting thing, you &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; have a thing that upsets you. The upsetting thing may not be, itself, the actual author you choose not to read; it may be your memory or impression of that author, or a thought you had once while reading that author, or something else. But if you are capable of thinking “ew, I won’t read that, it’ll just upset me” then you &lt;em&gt;have a thing that upsets you right now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you are &lt;em&gt;confused&lt;/em&gt; about how your mind works, and you think that you are actually &lt;em&gt;sparing&lt;/em&gt; yourself upset by avoiding the author.  You think that this state you’re in now – where you’re going “ew, that’ll upset me” – is what not being upset feels like.  But you’re wrong! This is actually an upset state.  This is a state of internal conflict, RIGHT NOW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean the “right” (anti-suffering) thing to do is to push through and read the article anyway.  The “right” thing to do would be to interrogate your &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; state of upset or inner conflict, see what’s going on there, try to resolve or dissolve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you don’t always have time to do that in practice; it takes time to “untangle” your thoughts, and if you untangled literally everything as it came up, you’d be spending a colossal amount of time in silent contemplation, and sometimes life wants us to respond faster than that. Although I suspect that perhaps if you actually did that colossal amount of contemplation, you’d eventually get faster at the untangling process, and also get rid of the “backlog” of unresolved inner conflicts you’re carrying around, so that afterwards you could deal with the world more or less in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what’s going on when we suffer. We think we are avoiding things that could hurt us, but we are actually &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; hurting, and stubbornly refusing to salve our present hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noticing More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The macho/stoic “just lean into the discomfort” thing is exactly the reverse of this cognitive-resolution perspective. It sounds similar, in that it also says “avoidance and denial is bad”, but it’s going in exactly the opposite direction.  It says to &lt;em&gt;override&lt;/em&gt; your sensitivities, rather than to become &lt;em&gt;so much more&lt;/em&gt; sensitive that you notice and fix the subtler aversions that come &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; whatever you’re currently avoiding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get good at noticing the subtle stuff, you’ll see that there are specific, discrete, but kinda…stupid? mental objects that are present in your mind.  They’re “stupid” in that, they’re usually nonverbal, and they’re kind of like the cells in DeepDream, they’re sort of shaped like one &lt;em&gt;component&lt;/em&gt; of a sense memory. “The way this shadow of a roof beam fell across the room one time on a middle school retreat in the woods, and the sharp smell of bug spray, and the way I had a vague sense of being unprepared to deal with physically challenging activities and being creeped out by the Evangelical Christian mottoes everywhere.”  Except that’s one single “note”, one brain-phenomenon, and it gets activated when I think about “why do I feel resistant to doing physically uncomfortable things like jumping into freezing cold water?”  I feel like “but ugh, [THIS]” where THIS is the roof-beam-shadow-in-the-lodge thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s how a big chunk of thoughts are &lt;em&gt;actually shaped&lt;/em&gt;, at least in my experience; we may just not talk about them because it sounds too weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I wonder sometimes if dealing with the “associative receptor field” or “emotional-sense-memory basis element” level of thought is actually what needs to happen to resolve a bunch of stuff and actually know what your mind is doing and reprogram it if you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance.  Why am I not going out for a run today? Well, I have a &lt;em&gt;memory&lt;/em&gt; – a snapshot sense-memory – of one time five years ago when I tried going out for a run when I was out of shape, and I was really embarrassed and humiliated; my throat was burning and I was almost in tears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would I feel that same way if I went running now? I don’t know. The road outside my door today looks different than that road in New Haven, the weather is different, I’m different, so maybe my experience will be different.  Intellectually that seems clear. But the loudest “note” in my mind is that full-body memory of it sucking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really think the &lt;em&gt;mechanics&lt;/em&gt; of why I’m not making the decision to go for that run are at the “evoked full-body memory” level of granularity.  It seems kind of…arrogant? to think I can just detect that; outside view, nobody is very good at understanding their “subconscious”, and fake-epiphanies where people think they can intentionally rewrite “subconscious” patterns (but they actually can’t) are a dime a dozen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don’t have the sense that I have mastered self-reprogramming, at all; I just have the sense that I know &lt;em&gt;where my decisions are coming from&lt;/em&gt;, and they’re these memory-fragments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, a thing is obviously not “subconscious” if you can &lt;em&gt;literally experience it in consciousness.&lt;/em&gt; I suspect that a lot of what people call “subconscious” is totally available to attention, just stuff that we expect ourselves not to attend to, especially because we don’t normally talk to &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; people about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could it be that attending to &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; internal phenomena is actually a “spiritual path” or a “self-improvement path” or whatever? There’s &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much more attention paid to overriding internal phenomena than exploring them; maybe most people know something I don’t, or maybe there’s a really persistent bias in the world of psychological advice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="tangled-thinking" /><category term="cog-psych" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How Effective is Non-Invasive Ventilation in COVID-19?</title><link href="/2020/03/22/non-invasive-ventilation.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How Effective is Non-Invasive Ventilation in COVID-19?" /><published>2020-03-22T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-03-22T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>/2020/03/22/non-invasive-ventilation</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2020/03/22/non-invasive-ventilation.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/totalfacemask.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cpapman&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does non-invasive ventilation even work in critically ill COVID-19 patients?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last post in this blog discussed whether non-invasive ventilation (NIV) can be effective in acute respiratory failure for any cause, and examined only randomized controlled trials of the intervention.  But is COVID-19 different?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There aren’t any controlled experimental trials of non-invasive ventilation for COVID-19 or related coronaviruses, so for this post we’ve had to look at retrospective observational studies. The evidence is weaker here. But it still looks like NIV can be helpful, at least in a large fraction of cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVID-19: Experiences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a retrospective analysis of 191 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in two hospitals in Wuhan, China, 41 received high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy; 33 (80%) of those died. 26 patients received non-invasive mechanical ventilation; 24 (92%) of those died. Finally, 32 received invasive mechanical ventilation; 31 (97%) of those died.  This was not a statistically significant difference between the survival rates of different respiratory support techniques.[1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a retrospective study of 60 severe COVID-19 patients from Jiangsu Province, China, 16 patients (26.7%) had respiratory failure. 14 patients received non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV), 15 received high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), 6 received both NIV and HFNC, and 3 received invasive mechanical ventilation.  14 (93%) of the HFNC patients improved; 9 (64%) of the NIV patients improved; this is not a statistically significant difference.  3 patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation; the paper did not list which therapies they had previously failed.[2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A retrospective on 631 patients in Jiangsu Province, China, reports that they were able to keep the rate of invasive mechanical ventilation under 1%, far below the Chinese average, despite a 10% rate of critically ill patients, by continuously monitoring high-risk patients and placing them on NIV or HFNC.[3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a retrospective of 53 critically ill COVID-19 patients from Wuhan, 33 were treated with HFNC and 52% survived; 29 were placed on NIV and 26% survived; and 22 were placed on invasive ventilation and 14% survived.  Of those placed on NIV, 48% had to be placed on invasive ventilation.[4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a preliminary (not-peer-reviewed) retrospective of 45 critically ill patients from Guangdong Province, China, with COVID-19, 6 (13.3%) were treated with standard oxygen therapy, 13 (28.9%) were treated with HNFC, 6 (13.3%) with NIV (all on a BiPAP), and 20 (44.4%) with invasive mechanical ventilation. Only one patient (2.2%) died in this cohort, compared to 62% in Wuhan. No patients treated with non-invasive oxygen therapies needed to be intubated.[5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a retrospective study of 267 confirmed COVID-19 patients from Chongqing Municipality, China, 5 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, 35 received non-invasive ventilation, 12 received HFNC, and 91 patients received standard oxygen therapy.  4 (1.5%) patients died in the entire study. All 50 patients with severe disease received oxygen, and all 50 needed further respiratory therapy; 2/35, or 5.7%, of patients on non-invasive ventilation needed to be intubated.[6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions Based on COVID-19 Published Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been no controlled studies of non-invasive ventilation for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a total of 70 COVID-19 patients, from three Chinese studies, treated with non-invasive ventilation, 23% needed to be intubated.  This is well within the range of failure of NIV for other causes of acute respiratory failure, and leaves it as an option that can still work in the majority of cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a total of 90 patients treated with HFNC, 56% died; in a total of 69 patients treated with NIV, 72% died; in a total of 54 patients treated with invasive ventilation, 93% died.  There is no statistically significant difference in the death rates between groups. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WHO’s clinical guidelines [7] on the use of NIV and HFNC in COVID-19 are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) should only be used in selected patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) should only be used in selected patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Patients treated with either HFNO or NIV should be closely monitored for clinical deterioration. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remark 1: Adult HFNO systems can deliver 60 L/min of gas flow and FiO2 up to 1.0. Paediatric circuits generally only handle up to 25 L/min, and many children will require an adult circuit to deliver adequate flow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remark 2: Due to uncertainty around the potential for aerosolization, HFO, NIV, including bubble CPAP, should be used with airborne precautions until further evaluation of the safety can be completed.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remark 3: Compared with standard oxygen therapy, HFNO reduces the need for intubation (42). Patients with hypercapnia (exacerbation of obstructive lung disease, cardiogenic pulmonary oedema), hemodynamic instability, multiorgan failure, or abnormal mental status should generally not receive HFNO, although emerging data suggest that HFNO may be safe in patients with mild-moderate and non-worsening hypercapnia (42, 43, 44). Patients receiving HFNO should be in a monitored setting and cared for by experienced personnel capable of endotracheal intubation in case the patient acutely deteriorates or does not improve after a short trial (about 1 hour). Evidence-based guidelines on HFNO do not exist, and reports on HFNO in other coronavirus-infected patients are limited (44).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much is known about the use of NIV and HFNO in COVID-19.  If possible, patients being given these therapies should be monitored in case they fail and the patient needs to be urgently intubated. However, what little evidence we have is in line with the results from other severe pulmonary diseases like pneumonia: in a majority of cases, non-invasive respiratory therapy can suffice and invasive mechanical ventilation can be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SARS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among 1512 patients with SARS in Guangdong Province, China, there were 58 deaths, for a case fatality rate of 3.8%, the lowest in the world. The author attributes this success to prompt treatment with corticosteroids and, in 20-30% of cases, with non-invasive ventilation (usually with a CPAP mask.)[8]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Hong Kong case series of SARS patients, non-invasive ventilation was reported to be able to avoid intubation in ⅔ of patients.[9]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a retrospective study of two hospitals in Hong Kong, one which used non-invasive ventilation with a BiPAP and one which only used invasive ventilation for SARS, 21.4% out of 42 patients needed to be intubated at the NIV hospital compared to 41.2% out of 451 patients at the invasive-ventilation hospital, a significant (p = 0.012) reduction in the need for intubation.  Also, the mortality rate was lower (9.5% vs 25.1%, p = 0.024) in the NIV hospital. Only 8/21 (38%) of NIV-treated patients needed to be intubated.  No healthcare workers acquired SARS at the NIV hospital.[10]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a meta-analysis of 4 studies comprising 96 SARS patients treated with NIV, the non-invasive ventilation treatment failed in a total of 51 patients, or 53%.[11]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In 17 studies of patients with H1N1 influenza comprising 551 patients treated with NIV, 338 or 61% failed the treatment.  The paper summarizes the use of NIV in H1N1 as follows: “NIV has a role in the management of early respiratory failure due to pH1N1 infection; however, in a strictly controlled environment with close monitoring of healthcare workers and with adequate precautions for prevention of infection transmission. NIV has no role in severe respiratory failure and ARDS related to severe pH1N1 infection.” [11]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 32 critically ill healthcare workers with MERS, 13 received NIV and 26 received invasive ventilation; that is, 7/13, or 54%, of patients treated with NIV failed and needed to be intubated. [12] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In COVID-19 and in other coronavirus epidemics (SARS and MERS), non-invasive ventilation significantly reduces the need for intubation. In the case of SARS, NIV has been shown to significantly reduce mortality as well. In these viruses, NIV has high failure rates – 20-60%, depending on the disease – so ideally it should be closely monitored in case the patient needs to be intubated. However, NIV succeeds often enough that it makes sense to use it for critically ill patients when invasive ventilation is not an option. (Some patients have a Do Not Intubate order, for instance.)  We don’t know much yet about how well it works in COVID-19, and there are no randomized studies, but from what little evidence we have, it seems that there’s a sizable proportion of patients who can benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula are treatments for acute respiratory failure, including in severe cases of viral pneumonia such as COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are reputed to be risky techniques that spread the virus, and are banned in many hospitals for the treatment of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We might ask some questions about this. Where is the evidence that non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and high-flow nasal cannula therapy (HFNC) spread viral particulates or droplets?  How far does this spread go?  And where on the mask does the spread come from?  (Could better masks that don’t cause this spread be designed?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at some of the literature on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 5-person study of high flow nasal cannula usage, in which the participants gargled with food dye and coughed, with and without wearing a well-fitting HFNC mask, cough-generated droplets spread to a mean (standard deviation) distance of 2.48 (1.03) m at baseline and 2.91 (1.09) m with HFNC. A maximum cough distance of 4.50 m was reported when using HFNC.  A separate study found that non-cough droplets extended a maximum of 62 cm when using HFNC. High-flow nasal cannula usage does spray cough droplets farther, by 0.42 m on average, than baseline.[1] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While HFNC can spread the virus farther than baseline, and farther than the 2-meter separation that’s the recommended minimum distance between COVID-19 patients in a hospital, it is unlikely to spread droplets from one room to another, for instance, through wall vents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive ventilation has been reported to increase the risk of viral transmission to healthcare workers in the case of SARS, but so did invasive ventilation.  Oxygen therapy and NIV can disperse air up to 1M around the patient.[2]  Again, this is not enough for virus particles to travel from room to room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study of 628 healthcare workers treating patients with severe SARS, presence in the room during non-invasive ventilation (p &amp;lt; 0.01), intubation (p &amp;lt; 0.01), and manual ventilation before intubation (p = 0.02) were independently associated with increased risk of healthcare workers contracting SARS; in a multivariate model, the only one of these procedures that stayed significant was intubation (OR = 2.79, p = 0.004).  Non-invasive ventilation and manual (bag mask) ventilation may be able to spread disease to healthcare workers, but no more so than intubation.[3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an experiment with noninvasive ventilation (BiPAP) with an oronasal face mask, on a dummy with a realistic model of human respiration, marking the air with smoke particles exhaled through the “airway”, smoke was found to leak from the mask through the six small exhaust holes on the nasal bridge of the mask.  The smoke leaked a maximum of 0.45 M away from the dummy.[4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study comparing non-invasive ventilation in normal subjects, subjects with cold symptoms, and subjects with infective exacerbations of chronic lung disease, NIV produced large (&amp;gt;10 um) droplets in the chronic lung disease and cold patients, but did not produce an aerosol. Due to the large size of droplets, most fall onto surfaces within 1M of the patient. Again, while healthcare workers are at risk (and need to wear personal protective equipment while treating patients with NIV) it is unlikely that NIV could send particulates into surrounding rooms.[5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study sampling the air around 39 H1N1 influenza patients after various procedures, noninvasive ventilation was not associated with a significantly increased risk of finding H1N1 RNA in the air.[6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is room for doubt, given the evidence, whether non-invasive ventilation in fact spreads virus particles to healthcare workers.  There is no evidence at all that particulates from non-invasive ventilation masks can spread more than a few meters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This matters because, in the event of a shortage of ICU beds and mechanical ventilators, if a device that can be used at home can reduce a COVID-19 patient’s risk of needing to be hospitalized, it could save potentially millions of lives in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at a total of 19 randomized controlled trials, comprising 3979 patients in all, which directly compared either a type of non-invasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula therapy, or both to standard oxygen therapy, for adult patients with acute respiratory failure who had not received surgery or intubation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a t-test to compare the risk of intubation between treatments, I found that there was a 15% rate of intubation in the non-invasive ventilation (NIV) group vs. a 30% rate of intubation in the standard therapy group, for a significant (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) difference in intubation risk; the NIV group had half the odds of failing and needing intubation, compared with standard oxygen mask therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, there was a significant (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) difference in the mortality risk; the NIV group had a mortality risk of 15% at follow-up, while the standard treatment group had a mortality rate of 24%, a relative risk of 0.625.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no significant reduction in risk of mortality or intubation between standard and high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When restricted to studies of community-acquired pneumonia, NIV still significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) reduces risk of intubation and significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) reduces the risk of mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Invasive Ventilation Vs. Standard Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an RCT of 236 patients admitted to the hospital for exacerbations of COPD, randomized to either standard treatment or non-invasive ventilation (NIV), NIV was associated with a reduced (RR = 0.56, p = 0.038) risk of needing intubation.[1]  Even in the NIV group, 15% of patients still needed intubation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a randomized study of 82 elderly patients with chronic pulmonary disease, randomized to receive NIV or standard therapy, the patients receiving NIV had a 7.3% chance of needing intubation, while the patients on standard (oxygen) therapy had a 63% chance; this is a significant difference (RR  = 0.11, p &amp;lt; 0.001).  The mortality rate at one year was also significantly lower in the NIV group (RR = 0.83, p = 0.014).[3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study (the 3CPO trial)  of 1069 patients with severe cardiogenic pulmonary edema, randomized to CPAP, non-invasive ventilation, or standard oxygen therapy, there was no significant difference in the rate of mortality (9.8% vs 9.5%) or intubation (2.8% vs 2.9%) between groups.[4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a randomized multicenter study over 19 hospitals in China, patients given NIV for exacerbations of COPD were much less likely than patients given standard therapy, (4% vs 15%, RR = 0.13, p = 0.002) but there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality.[5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a randomized study of 40 patients with acute lung injury, assigned either NIV or standard oxygen therapy, the proportion of patients requiring intubation was much lower in the NIV group (5% vs 37%: RR = 0.14, p = 0.02) and there was a nonsignificant trent (p = 0.09) towards lower mortality in the NIV group.[6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a randomized study of 40 patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, assigned to either NIV or standard oxygen therapy, intubation was required in fewer patients in the NIV group (5% vs 33%, RR = 0.15, p = 0.037).[7]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study of 85 patients with acute exacerbations of COPD, randomized to standard therapy or noninvasive ventilation, significantly fewer of the NIV patients (26% vs 74%, RR = 35%, p &amp;lt; 0.001) were intubated.  NIV patients also had fewer complications, shorter hospital stays, and lower in-hospital mortality (9% vs 29%, RR = 0.31, p =0.02).[9]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a randomized study of 105 patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, randomized to NIV or standard oxygen therapy, NIV reduced the need for intubation (13% vs 29%, RR = 0.45, p = 0.01) and ICU mortality (9% vs 21%, RR = 0.42, p = 0.028).[13]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the FLORALI trial, which randomized 310 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure to high-flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNC), non-invasive ventilation, or standard oxygen therapy through a nonrebreather mask, there was no significant difference in intubation rate between the three groups; but in the patient subgroup with the worst blood oxygenation levels, the high-flow oxygen group had a significantly lower intubation rate (35% vs 53%, RR = 0.66, p = 0.009).  Mortality at 90 days was also significantly lower in the high-flow nasal cannula group (12% vs 23%, RR = 0.52, p= 0.02).[14]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the HOT-ER trial of 302 patients with hypoxia and tachypnea presenting to an emergency department, randomly assigned to standard oxygen therapy or HFNC therapy, there was no significant difference between mortality and intubation rates, but this may have been because both groups had low rates of intubation (0.6% and 2.2%) and in-hospital mortality (9.1% and 8.0%).[15]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the HIGH trial of 776 adult immunocompromised patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, randomized to HFNC or standard oxygen, there was no significant difference between groups in mortality at day 28 (35.6% vs 36.1%) or intubation rate (38.7% vs 43.6%).[17]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a trial of 376 immunocompromised patients, mostly with cancer, randomized to either non-invasive ventilation or standard oxygen therapy, there was no significant difference in intubation rates between the two groups (24.1% vs 27.3%) and no significant difference in 28-day mortality (24.1% vs 27.3%)[19]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a randomized study of 31 patients with acute respiratory failure, randomized to non-invasive ventilation or standard oxygen, significantly fewer patients in the NIV group needed intubation (31% vs 73%, RR = 0.42, p = 0.03), but there was no significant difference in mortality.[20]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 52 immunosuppressed patients with acute respiratory distress, pulmonary infiltrates, and fever, randomized either to NIV or standard oxygen, fewer patients in the NIV group required intubation (46% vs 76%, RR = 0.6, p = 0.03) and fewer patients in the NIV died in the hospital (50% vs 81%, RR= 0.58, p = 0.02).[21]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a randomized study of 60 patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, assigned to CPAP, BIPAP, or standard oxygen, patients assigned to CPAP were more likely to survive to hospital discharge (100% vs 70 % vs 75%, p = 0.02).  There was no difference in the number of patients needing intubation: (20% vs 5% vs 5%).[22]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an Indian study of 40 patients with acute exacerbations of COPD randomized to NIV or standard oxygen, the NIV group had a lower rate of intubation (15% vs 60%, RR = 0.25, p = 0.003) but there was no significant difference in hospital mortality (15% vs 20%).[23]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pneumonia-Specific Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a randomized study of 56 cases of severe pneumonia, assigned to NIV (with a CPAP mask) or standard oxygen therapy, significantly fewer patients in the NIV group (21% vs 61%, RR = 34%, p = 0.007) met criteria for intubation.  There was no significant difference in hospital death rates or 2-month survival rates.[8]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a randomized study of 81 patients with acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia, randomized to NIV with a CPAP or standard oxygen therapy with a Venturi mask, significantly fewer from the CPAP group met criteria for intubation (15% vs 63%, RR = 0.24, p &amp;lt; 0.001), and the CPAP group showed a faster and greater oxygenation response.[12]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of Non-Invasive Ventilation Compared&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a meta-analysis comprising 290 patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, there was no significant difference in either hospital mortality or intubation risk between CPAP and BIPAP machines. [2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 36 patients with acute hypercapnic pulmonary edema randomized to either non-invasive pressure support ventilation or CPAP, there was no significant difference in intubation rates or mortality rates.[18]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 83 women with ARDS randomized to NIV either with a face mask or a helmet, the rate of intubation was significantly lower with the helmet (18% vs 63%, RR = 0.29, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and the 90-day mortality rate was also significantly lower (34% vs 56%, RR= 0.6, p = 0.02).  The helmet may be more effective because it prevents air leak.[16]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Out-of-Hospital Non-Invasive Ventilation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a randomized study of 54 patients with acute respiratory failure given standard oxygen therapy or NIV by paramedics, significantly fewer of the NIV patients needed to go to the ICU (36% vs 65%, RR = 0.55, p &amp;lt; 0.05) and there was a nonsignificant trend towards fewer NIV patients needing to be intubated (4% vs 23%, p = 0.1) [10]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Past Pandemics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20-30% of patients with respiratory failure due to H1N1 influenza were given NIV, but 70-80% of those later needed intubation and invasive ventilation.[11]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the SARS outbreak, a Hong Kong hospital that treated patients with respiratory failure through non-invasive ventilation first had 21% of patients need invasive mechanical ventilation, while 41% of SARS patients in a ventilation-first hospital were on mechanical ventilation.  Mortality was also lower in the NIV hospital: 9.5% vs 25.1%.[24]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like, for acute respiratory distress in general and pneumonia specifically, non-invasive ventilation can help prevent it from getting so bad that intubation is necessary.  NIV reduces both intubation risk and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that, in a world where ICUs are overrun, there’s a good chance that a home non-invasive ventilation device could save lives for people with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we have correlational evidence that non-invasive ventilation can work for acute respiratory failure outside a hospital setting, and can reduce mortality in a past coronavirus epidemic (SARS). This points in favor of the possibility of non-invasive ventilation being useful in COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because non-invasive ventilation aerosolizes the virus, it is not safe in hospital settings, where it could spread COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone has the option of going to a hospital in the event of severe respiratory failure due to COVID-19, it’s better to go immediately than to try to self-treat at home; intubation can’t be done safely by an untrained person, and about 40% of severe COVID-19 cases require intubation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if hospitals are unavailable, as seems quite likely if the US doesn’t drastically increase its supply of medical personnel and equipment, a home non-invasive ventilation device may be a distinct improvement over either home oxygen supplementation or, obviously, no treatment at all.&lt;/p&gt;
