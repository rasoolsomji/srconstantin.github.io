<p>This is an overview and rough effect-size scoring of biomarkers associated with all-cause mortality in observational studies drawn from general populations (i.e. _not _in patients diagnosed with a disease.)</p>

<p>The hazard ratio numbers in the chart are calculated by averaging the hazard ratios in the studies cited below, weighted by study size. Hazard ratios measure the relative risk of all-cause mortality in the “top” vs. “bottom” bin (tertiles, quartiles, etc) of the biomarker.  These averaged numbers should be taken with a grain of salt, because they’re aggregating the results of studies that aren’t strictly comparable; I’ve freely averaged hazard ratios between studies that used different binning formats, or different study populations (differing by country, age, gender, etc) or different follow-up period lengths, or different adjustment procedures (all hazard ratios are adjusted for age and sex, but many are additionally adjusted for other risk factors, like BMI or cholesterol.)  This isn’t intended to be a true meta-analysis, and the rank-ordering of the biomarkers by effect size may not be exact.</p>

<p>The purpose here is to illustrate and summarize what sorts of biomarkers that predict mortality have been observed so far, and to notice some patterns.</p>

<p>First of all, “clinical” rather than biochemical predictors do quite well.</p>

<p>People’s self-assessments of their own health are highly predictive of their mortality risk.  A single measurement of grip strength isn’t far behind. A simple frailty index consisting of 3 criteria (recent weight loss, difficulty standing, self-reported energy levels) does even better.  This is roughly what I’d have predicted; with few exceptions, the best “biomarker of aging” we have is direct observation of the subject’s state of overall health.</p>

<p>The Horvath and Hannum methylation “clocks” (patterns of methylation abnormalities associated with chronological age) don’t have particularly big impacts on mortality risk compared to frailty and self-reported health. The Zhang clock, which came out in 2017, looks quite a bit <a href="https://joshmitteldorf.scienceblog.com/2019/02/25/progress-in-methylation-based-aging-clocks/">better</a> at predicting mortality. That’s to be expected, since it’s a model trained on mortality rates, not ages.  (In my table I ignored the paper where the Zhang clock is tested on the dataset used to train it, which had an even larger hazard ratio but seemed like an overfitting risk.)  It remains to be seen if other researchers will replicate the Zhang clock.</p>

<p>There are some individual biomarkers that also seem to actually have comparable or larger effects on mortality risk than self-reported health or frailty.</p>

<p>Several are cardiac stress markers.  Troponin T is a protein involved in muscle contractions and elevated during heart attacks.  ST2, the receptor for the cardioprotective cytokine IL-33, is a cardiac biomarker that signals fibrosis from heart failure. (High levels of circulating ST2 in the blood bind to IL-33 and prevent it from doing its job in the heart.)  NT-proBNP is a prohormone secreted by the heart muscle to reduce blood pressure and cardiac output; it is elevated in heart failure.</p>

<p>Others seem to be generalized stress responses.  GDF15 is an inflammatory cytokine which is upregulated during injury to organs and increases with age.  YKL-40 is a glycoprotein which is secreted in response to inflammation, fibrosis, and cancer.  IL-6 is an inflammatory cytokine, nicknamed the “gerontologist’s cytokine”, which is involved in inflammatory and stress responses and is associated with many age-related diseases.</p>

<p>Still others are involved in nutrient sensing.  IGFBP1 is the binding protein for IGF-1, a key protein in the insulin-signaling/nutrient-sensing pathway.  It prevents IGF-1 from taking glucose out of the bloodstream and into tissues to be used for growth; that is, IGFBP1 is anti-proliferative.  It increases with age, and high levels are associated with mortality.  Klotho, on the other hand, is an inhibitor of the insulin-signaling pathway that _decreases _with age, and _low _levels are associated with age-related diseases and mortality.</p>

<p>Homocysteine is an amino acid variant; in high concentrations, it damages cells, leading to blood clots, atherosclerosis, and dementia. Homocysteine levels increase with age and can be elevated by B vitamin deficiencies.</p>

<p>Vitamin D production declines with age as a result of impaired renal function; low vitamin D increases the risk of fractures and falls.</p>

<p>Albumin is a protein that regulates blood volume; serum albumin declines with age as a result of impaired liver function and reduced protein intake.</p>

<p>Most of these markers seem more likely to be warning signs of aging processes than viable targets for anti-aging drugs, but they could be useful for more quickly predicting whether interventions are having anti-aging effects on an organism.  Though, as always, when you use a proxy metric without knowing the mechanism, you can’t be sure that the causality goes the right way; for all you know, the intervention is just directly altering the biomarker but not touching the progression of age-related disease.  This is why it’s good to observe that measures of frailty and physical performance are some of the best predictors of mortality; even if we don’t have the time for a long-term study on mortality, an intervention that’s shown to improve frailty is _definitely _valuable for the quality of life of the elderly, while we can’t have that same certainty about an intervention that only affects the concentration of some molecule in the blood.</p>

<p>Additionally, some biomarkers for mortality, like Klotho, <em>do</em> seem to have direct effects on aging and lifespan – mice that overexpress _Klotho _live longer, and a recently founded <a href="https://www.klotho.com/">startup</a> is trying to develop a version of the protein as a treatment for chronic kidney disease.</p>

<p><strong>Biomarkers</strong></p>

<p><em>Albumin</em></p>

<p>In a prospective study of 4116 men and women over 70, low albumin was associated with a 1.9x relative risk of all-cause mortality in men, and a 3.7x relative risk in women, after adjusting for age, race, chronic conditions, and disability status.  Unadjusted, those relative risks are 4.6 and 10.0 respectively.[6]</p>

<p>In the Estonian Biobank (n=9842) and a cohort from Finland (n=7503) adjusted relative risks of all-cause mortality were elevated due to the following biomarkers: alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (RR = 1.67),low albumin  (RR = 1.42), very low density LDL particle size (RR = 0.69) and citrate (1.33).  Albumin was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality, with p&lt;10^(-25).[7]</p>

<p>Top-quintile CRP levels had a 2.32x RR for all-cause mortality (p &lt; 0.0001) in a study of 1395 men.[23]</p>

<p>In 675 elderly people over age 70, top-quartile  CRP was associated with a 1.7x adjusted risk of all-cause mortality.[24]</p>

<p>In 242 men aged 50-75, DHEA was not significantly associated with all-cause mortality, though it was associated with cardiovascular mortality.[31]</p>

<p><em>Endothelin-1</em></p>

<p>In 1440 healthy subjects, plasma endothelin was a predictor of all-cause mortality (RR = 1.11)[32]</p>

<p><em>Fibrinogen</em></p>

<p>In a cohort of 1851 subjects, the Zhang methylation score was associated with a hazard ratio of all-cause mortality per standard deviation of 1.62, so 2.62 for top 15% vs. bottom 15%, while the Horvath clock had an HR of 1.16 per standard deviation, and the frailty index had an HR of 1.42 per standard deviation, or 2.02 for top 15% vs. bottom 15%.[37]</p>

<p>In 3132 older men, the hazard ratio of “frail” (top 13% in frailty score according to the SOF index) vs. “robust” (bottom 44%) was 2.53.  The hazard ratio for the top 14% vs. bottom 32% for the CHS index was 3.51.[38]</p>

<p>In 6701 older women, the odds ratio for all-cause mortality among frail women by the CHS standard (top 17% vs. bottom 37%) was 2.75; for the SOF index (top 16% vs. bottom 47%) was 2.37.[39]</p>

<p><em>GDF15</em></p>

<p>In 876 Swedish men, age 35-80, serum GDF15 levels predicted all-cause mortality with an adjusted odds ratio of 3.38, p&lt;0.0001.’[40]</p>

<p>In 940 subjects in the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men, the top quartile of GDF-15 was associated with a 2.19x risk of all-cause mortality.[41]</p>
