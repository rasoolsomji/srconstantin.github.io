Hi! I'm Sarah Constantin, and this is my blog.

Brief bio: I started out studying math (Princeton AB '10, Yale PhD '15, focusing on applied harmonic analysis) and then spent some time in the world of data science and machine learning (Palantir, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Starsky Robotics.)

I've always been fascinated by biology, and I founded [LRI][lri]  to help fund research into interventions that extend lifespan, and [Daphnia Labs][daphnia] to accelerate drug discovery through automation and machine learning.

I think in writing, and this blog is a way for me to collect and express ideas. It's pretty eclectic, but the recurrent themes are a.) deep dives into the scientific literature to investigate things I'm curious about; b.) reflections on how to think well.

I live in California with my husband and 2-year-old son.
